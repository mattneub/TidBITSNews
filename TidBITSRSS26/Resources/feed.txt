				<description><![CDATA[<p>Over the last year, cloud storage services <a href="https://www.box.com/home">Box</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage">Microsoft OneDrive</a>—and probably others—have migrated from custom kernel extensions to Apple’s new-ish File Provider extension. It provides an Apple-approved framework for integrating remote files into macOS and displaying them in the Finder. I touched on this move a year ago in “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2022/02/04/cloud-storage-forecast-unsettled-with-possible-storms/">Cloud Storage Forecast Unsettled, with Possible Storms</a>” (4 February 2022).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileprovider">File Provider extension</a> first appeared in macOS 12.1 Monterey, though Apple’s Developer site suggests that it may have subsequently been made available in macOS 10.15 Catalina. Earlier versions of macOS don’t support it, so nothing changes for those running older systems for now. The cloud storage services will likely pull support for older systems at some point, but there’s no telling when that will happen. (Everything I say below I’ve tested in macOS 13.2.1 Ventura—it’s possible, even likely, that some details are different in Monterey.)</p>
<p>The cloud storage companies undoubtedly felt they had little choice about adopting the File Provider extension because Apple said it would be deprecating kernel extensions at some point. That hasn’t happened yet, but Apple often gives developers several years to get with the program.</p>
<p>My understanding is that Box, Google, and Microsoft have migrated their Mac users to the File Provider approach, whereas Dropbox—probably the most popular among everyday Mac users—has only recently started to encourage those outside its beta program to switch (while others are still being asked to join the beta). It can be hard to tell since cloud storage providers often roll out changes over time or to subsets of customers to test user response, identify concerns, and reduce support loads. Some Dropbox users even report one Mac being upgraded to the new File Provider approach, while others continue to use the kernel extension.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-change.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61892" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-change.png" alt="Dropbox migration dialog" width="1406" height="846" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-change.png 1406w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-change-1280x770.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1406px) 100vw, 1406px" /></a></p>
<p>Although it’s good to have cloud storage integrated into macOS in a coherent fashion, the switch to Apple’s File Provider extension brings with it two key changes that will require adjustments in how you work.</p>
<p>The first change is where local files are stored. All cloud-storage services must now store their files in <code>~/Library/CloudStorage</code>. (That’s in your home folder’s Library folder, which is non-trivial to access for most users since the Library folder is hidden by default.) From a consistency and coherency point of view, the new standard location is a good thing, since users don’t have to keep track of where each individual service might have its files. However, just as when Mac OS X introduced the home folder and its now-canonical subfolders (Desktop, Documents, Library, Movies, Music, and so on), the loss of flexibility will create pain points for some users.</p>
<p>The second change revolves around whether the files exist both locally and online (“offline” or “pinned”) or just online (“online-only”). Both have advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Offline files</b> are stored both on the cloud and on the local drive for quick access. However, they consume local storage space, which may be a problem if you’re low on free space. There’s no visible indication that a file is offline.</li>
<li><b>Online-only files</b> exist locally only as icon placeholders until they’re opened—they have little cloud icons next to their names in the Finder. This approach saves space, but may suffer from loading delays with large files or slow connections. Of course, online-only files aren’t available if you lack connectivity.<br />
<a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Cloud-icons.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61887 alignnone" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Cloud-icons.png" alt="Showing cloud icons" width="1388" height="730" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Cloud-icons.png 1388w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Cloud-icons-1280x673.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1388px) 100vw, 1388px" /></a></li>
</ul>
<p>After you first migrate a cloud storage service to the File Provider approach, assume that all your files and folders are online-only. That might not be the case—you can tell by looking for the little cloud icons—but such files, as I’ll discuss below, can’t be viewed using Quick Look, indexed by Spotlight, or backed up by Time Machine and other backup apps.</p>
<p>You can control the state of any file or folder. If you click the cloud icon next to a file or folder name, that initiates a download, turning it from online-only to offline. Control-click an offline file and you’ll find commands for downloading files (making them offline) or removing their downloads (making them online-only). Dropbox (below left) relies on Make Available Offline and Make Online-Only commands in the Quick Actions section at the bottom of the pop-up menu. Google Drive (below right) puts Download Now and Remove Download commands at the top of the menu; it has Quick Actions as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Offline-online-menu-options.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61888" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Offline-online-menu-options.png" alt="Contextual menus for making files offline or online-only" width="1626" height="1644" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Offline-online-menu-options.png 1626w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Offline-online-menu-options-1280x1294.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Offline-online-menu-options-1519x1536.png 1519w" sizes="(max-width: 1626px) 100vw, 1626px" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, opening an online-only file in an app also downloads it. It’s possible that a third-party app would be unhappy when fed a file that hasn’t yet been downloaded; if you get an error, make sure the file is available offline and try again.</p>
<p>To be clear, this distinction between offline and online-only files isn’t new or unique to the File Provider extension. All the cloud storage services have provided ways to specify which files or folders were kept locally and which existed only online. The details and implications varied somewhat, but the concept was the same.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the impacts of these File Provider changes. I focus on Dropbox and Google Drive below because those are the services I use regularly, but Box and OneDrive should be similar in most cases.</p>
<h2>Sidebar Locations May Change</h2>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Finder-Settings-Cloud-Storage.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-61891" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Finder-Settings-Cloud-Storage.png" alt="Cloud Storage in Finder Settings" width="320" height="743" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Finder-Settings-Cloud-Storage.png 756w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Finder-Settings-Cloud-Storage-661x1536.png 661w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>The File Provider approach brings cloud storage services into parity with one another and with other forms of storage in macOS. As a result, Apple has decreed that they appear by default in the Finder window sidebar under Locations. You can even turn them all on and off in Finder &gt; Settings/Preferences &gt; Sidebar.</p>
<p>The new spot may cause some minor confusion, if you previously kept the Locations item closed in the sidebar or regularly accessed Dropbox or Google Drive, for instance, from sidebar items under Favorites. However, you can drag any cloud storage service’s sidebar item from Locations to Favorites or even have them in both Locations and Favorites.</p>
<p>This change is minor and easily tweaked however you prefer, but I mention it first because you should click any sidebar items you have and make sure they still work and, more importantly, still work properly.</p>
<h2>Look Out for Disconnected Local Folders</h2>
<p>Why might a sidebar item not go to the right place? When a cloud storage service switches from its custom kernel extension to the File Provider extension, the location of its local folder moves from wherever you had it to <code>~/Library/CloudStorage</code>. Or at least that’s the goal.</p>
<p>(As a quick reminder, if you don’t see the Library folder in your home folder, hold Option and click the Go menu, which makes Library visible. Or, with the home folder open, choose View &gt; Show View Options and select Show Library Folder to make it always visible.)</p>
<p>Some users, including us, have experienced situations where the local folder doesn’t move but becomes disconnected from the service. Since the cloud storage service will immediately sync to the new location, you can end up with two Dropbox folders, for instance, one at <code>~/Dropbox</code> and another at <code>~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox</code>.</p>
<p>The cloud storage services somewhat muddy the waters by creating what looks like an alias (really a symlink) in their old locations to maintain continuity for users. But is that Dropbox folder in your home folder a symlink or a disconnected local folder? Check by opening Terminal and typing <code>ls -l</code> (if you&#8217;re not already in your home folder, use the <code>cd</code> command first). As you can see below, I now have Dropbox and Google Drive folder symlinks in my home folder. Notice how the symlinks have an <code>l</code> in the leftmost column, whereas directories like Downloads and Library start with a <code>d</code> and the Dropbox Demo Alias I made for illustration has a <code>-</code>.</p>

<p>Verify your findings by copying a new file into the local folder and then checking on the cloud storage service’s website to see if it was uploaded.</p>
<p>If you do have a disconnected local folder, you’ll have to do some spot checks to make sure everything in it also exists in the online version. I do that by using List View in the Finder, sorting by Date Modified, and then expanding the folders and checking that the most recent files are in both places. When I ran into this with Google Drive, I had only a handful of files that were out of sync, but if you see a lot of differences, consider using synchronization software like <a href="https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html">ChronoSync</a> to figure out which files need to be moved.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-List-View.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61883" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-List-View.png" alt="Identifying recent files in List View" width="1402" height="652" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-List-View.png 1402w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-List-View-1280x595.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1402px) 100vw, 1402px" /></a></p>
<p>Be sure to delete the disconnected local folder once you’re done to avoid accidentally using it later. If the service doesn’t subsequently create a symlink automatically for you, I recommend making one with these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Terminal, type <code>cd</code> and press Return to ensure you’re in your home folder.</li>
<li>Type <code>ln -s </code> (leave a space after the <code>s</code>).</li>
<li>In the Finder, choose Go &gt; Go to Folder, type <code>~/Library/CloudStorage</code>, and press Return to open that folder.<br />
<a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Go-to-Folder.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61901 alignnone" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Go-to-Folder.png" alt="Go to Folder dialog" width="462" height="182" /></a></li>
<li>Drag the cloud storage service folder—Dropbox or Google Drive, say—from the Finder to the Terminal window to insert its path. This approach is necessary because at least Google Drive actually has a different name than what you see. Press Return to create the symlink.<br />
<a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/symlink-command.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61899 alignnone" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/symlink-command.png" alt="symlink command" width="1562" height="272" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/symlink-command.png 1562w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/symlink-command-1280x223.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/symlink-command-1536x267.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1562px) 100vw, 1562px" /></a></li>
</ol>
<h2>References to Local Files and Folders May Break</h2>
<p>In an ideal world, if the cloud storage service created an alias of its relocated local folder from <code>~/Library/CloudStorage</code> to wherever you had it previously, any aliases or other references to files or folders in that folder should continue to work.</p>
<p>However, that’s not always the case, especially if you had to clean up a disconnected local folder. If you deleted your disconnected local folder, as I recommend, any aliases that pointed to files or folders in it will break. That’s good, since then you know to recreate them.</p>
<p>Similarly, some apps like BBEdit, Keyboard Maestro, and Transmit can optionally store support files in cloud storage as a way of syncing settings and other data between Macs. In the ideal world described above, everything should keep working, and that was my experience with my most recent Dropbox migration with a few Keyboard Maestro macros that reference Automator workflows and BBEdit text filters that I had stored in Dropbox.</p>
<p>However, there are no guarantees that references to files will all resolve to the new locations, and in the case of apps that use cloud storage for syncing settings, you may not even notice immediately. For hints about which apps might be leveraging cloud storage for syncing, look through your various cloud storage folders, Dropbox in particular.</p>
<h2>External Drive Support Disappears, Except for OneDrive</h2>
<p>The most significant limitation of the new File Provider approach is that <code>~/Library/CloudStorage</code> is located on your internal drive. For those with terabytes of files in a cloud storage service, that’s a huge problem.</p>
<p>Previously, you could specify where you wanted your cloud storage service’s local folder to live, making it easy to locate it on a large external drive. With File Provider, that’s no longer possible. Or so <a href="https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407737091219-Using-Box-Drive-on-macOS-File-Provider-Extension-FPE-mode">Box</a>, <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/installs/macos-support-for-expected-changes">Dropbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/12178485?visit_id=638138216126580276-939689965&amp;p=file_provider&amp;rd=1#fileprovider&amp;zippy=%2Cwhy-am-i-being-asked-to-enable-google-drive%2Cwhere-do-i-find-my-streaming-files-now%2Chow-does-this-functionality-differ-from-what-i-had-before">Google</a> are saying at the moment, although <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/inside-the-new-files-on-demand-experience-on-macos/ba-p/3058922#Update">Microsoft has worked around the limitation</a> with OneDrive by separating the “sync root” (which has to remain in <code>~/Library/CloudStorage</code>) from the cache, which can live on an external drive.</p>
<p>Users are up in arms about this change, particularly those who use Dropbox to keep audio or video processing workstations updated with very large shared files.</p>
<p>The news isn’t entirely bad. On 17 February 2023, Dropbox posted a note in a long and vitriolic thread about the loss of external drive support, saying that <a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Storage-Space/Disaster-Dropbox-removing-external-disk-support-for-Mac-users/m-p/660964/highlight/true#M10412">the company was working on a solution</a> and users who have their Dropbox folder on an external drive wouldn’t be upgraded in the meantime.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-statement.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61893" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-statement.png" alt="" width="1548" height="854" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-statement.png 1548w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-statement-1280x706.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-statement-1536x847.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1548px) 100vw, 1548px" /></a></p>
<p>If waiting for Dropbox isn’t an option, consider the open-source Dropbox client <a href="https://maestral.app/">Maestral</a>. It allows you to locate your Dropbox folder anywhere you want, including on an external drive. Maestral relies on the public Dropbox API, which prevents it from transferring only the parts of a file that change from save to save—a binary diff. Instead, Maestral has to transfer entire files, which will be slower and use more bandwidth. Maestral doesn’t count toward Dropbox’s three-device limit for basic accounts (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2019/03/14/dropbox-limits-free-accounts-to-three-devices/">Dropbox Limits Free Accounts to Three Devices</a>,” 14 March 2019).</p>
<p>There might be another workaround, which is to <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254322298">relocate your entire home folder</a> to an external drive. Control-click a user in System Settings/Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups to access the Home Directory field. Don’t even think about doing this—even with a test account—unless you’re technically adept and have made multiple backups first.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Relocate-home-folder.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61882" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Relocate-home-folder.png" alt="Relocating the home folder in Ventura" width="506" height="558" /></a></p>
<p>Even assuming that relocating the home folder to an external drive works as desired, there are negatives. It won’t work well for laptops, of course, and if you don’t wish to shell out for an expensive SSD, you’ll suffer from the slower performance of a hard drive. In addition, there’s some <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254143123">online discussion</a> about how installing macOS updates while logged into an account located on an external drive can cause problems; the advice seems to be to <a href="https://www.codycabanaproductions.com/post/macos-updates-never-do-what-i-just-did">update macOS while using an administrator-level account on the internal drive</a>. If you try this, let us know in the comments how it works.</p>
<p>For thrill-seekers who have the necessary technical chops and excellent backups, there are other options you could try—again, let us know in the comments if either of these works:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dropbox:</b> If you’ve already migrated Dropbox to the File Provider approach, a user posted a possible workaround in <a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Apps-and-Installations/Moving-Dropbox-folder-from-Library-CloudStorage/td-p/654021/highlight/true">another Dropbox Community thread</a>. It involves using a symlink to point at the Dropbox folder on an external drive, similar to what Microsoft does with OneDrive. In the recent past, Dropbox hasn’t supported symlinks to items on external drives, but perhaps that’s changed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Google Drive:</b> Although Google Drive claims you cannot change its location, <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/159983654?hl=en&amp;msgid=162498347">a May 2022 discussion in the Google Drive Help forum</a> recommends using the Unix <code>touch</code> command to create a file in a particular location. The suggestion is that doing so causes the Google Drive app to revert to pre-File Provider behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dragging Files Moves Rather Than Copies</h2>
<p>Some of the cloud storage services used their kernel extensions to treat their local folder as a separate volume. The practical upshot was that dragging a file to or from the service’s local folder resulted in a <i>copy</i> action, leaving the original in place and making a new version in the destination location. Reasonable people can differ about whether this was the right or wrong thing to do, but regardless, it’s what users became accustomed to.</p>
<p>With the File Provider approach, all the cloud storage services are essentially folders on the internal drive, not separate volumes, so dragging a file from your Desktop to your Dropbox folder <i>moves</i> the file rather than copying it, as does dragging a file from Google Drive to the Desktop.</p>
<p>That’s an important change because the services also have to maintain an online copy of the file, so at least Dropbox and Google Drive interpret moving a file to another folder in the Finder as a deletion of the online version, putting the moved file in the service’s online trash. Both also alert you to what’s happening, and you can turn the alerts off.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Move-warnings.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61884" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Move-warnings.png" alt="Dropbox and Google Drive move warnings" width="523" height="322" /></a></p>
<h2>Trashing Retains Online Copies, but Local Behavior May Vary</h2>
<p>So what happens when you use the Finder to delete a file from a cloud storage service? It varies, and I can speak only to what happens with Dropbox and Google Drive, but I suspect Box and OneDrive will be similar to one or the other of these approaches. If that’s not the case, please contribute additional details in the comments.</p>
<p>With Dropbox, you’ll see different behavior based on whether the file is offline or online-only. When you trash an offline file, it simply moves to the Trash like any other file in the Finder. You can put it back, move it to another location, or delete it permanently by emptying the Trash. However, when you delete an online-only file, Dropbox alerts you that the file will be deleted immediately (below left). When Dropbox says that you can’t undo the action, it means that it’s not putting the file in the Mac’s Trash, so Command-Z won’t work. However, deleting either type of file moves it to the Deleted Files collection on the Dropbox website, where it stays for 30 days before being deleted permanently (below right).</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-trash-deleted-files.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61885" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-trash-deleted-files.png" alt="Deleting files in Dropbox" width="2690" height="1204" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-trash-deleted-files.png 2690w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-trash-deleted-files-1280x573.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-trash-deleted-files-1536x687.png 1536w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Dropbox-trash-deleted-files-2048x917.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2690px) 100vw, 2690px" /></a></p>
<p>Google Drive has no such distinction. When you delete any file in Google Drive, offline or online-only, it moves into the Mac’s Trash like any other file. You can press Command-Z to undo the deletion. Online-only files retain their cloud icons while in the Trash. As with Dropbox, Google Drive also puts deleted files in its online trash, as you can see with the two ChartOfAccounts files I’ve deleted in the screenshots below. Again, deleted files remain available online for 30 days.</p>

<h2>Searches May Work Poorly for Cloud-Based Content</h2>
<p>The offline/online-only state of files has implications for searching. Unsurprisingly, if a file is online-only, there’s no way Spotlight can index its content. However, filename searches in Finder windows should work, as should searches in third-party utilities like <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/freeware">EasyFind</a> or <a href="http://apps.tempel.org/FindAnyFile/">Find Any File</a>.</p>
<p>Google Drive offers an easy workaround for content searches. You can bring up a custom Google Drive search dialog in the Finder; the default keyboard shortcut is Command-Option-G. It runs the search on Google Drive on the Web, which can easily search the full content of your files stored in Google Drive. It also finds content in Google Docs and Google Sheets, which wouldn’t ever show up in Spotlight, since they exist on local drives only as pointers to the online data.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Google-Drive-search.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61889" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Google-Drive-search.png" alt="Google Drive search dialog" width="1606" height="638" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Google-Drive-search.png 1606w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Google-Drive-search-1280x508.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Google-Drive-search-1536x610.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1606px) 100vw, 1606px" /></a></p>
<h2>Backups Work, But…</h2>
<p>By now, you can see that online-only files don’t really exist on your Mac. That means Time Machine and other backup solutions cannot back them up. It appears as though all Dropbox <i>folders</i> appear in Time Machine, though only <i>offline files</i> show up in them. In contrast, Google Drive’s folders only appear if they contain offline files. Similarly, Backblaze sees and backs up offline files in <code>~/Library/CloudStorage</code>, but it doesn’t know about online-only files at all. That’s why there are only two files in the folder shown below.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Backblaze-offline-backups.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61890" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Backblaze-offline-backups.png" alt="Backblaze restore showing only offline files" width="2000" height="1102" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Backblaze-offline-backups.png 2000w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Backblaze-offline-backups-1280x705.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Backblaze-offline-backups-1536x846.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a></p>
<p>As I noted at the top, you should assume that everything in a cloud storage service is online-only to start and thus isn’t being backed up separately. That might not concern you—after all, the data all exists in the cloud. However, if you’re sharing folders with other people, it’s possible for them to delete files or entire folders accidentally (or maliciously), thus removing them from everyone in the share group. In theory, they should be available in an online trash or Deleted Files collection, but you may not want to bet on that. A local backup made with Time Machine, Backblaze, Super Duper, or any other app can protect you from such mistakes.</p>
<p>Such things happen—Tonya recently ran into a situation where someone in her workgroup inadvertently deleted an important Box folder containing weeks of work. There might have been other ways of recovering it, but copying from her Time Machine backup was quick and didn’t require opening a ticket with IT support.</p>
<p>Therefore, assuming you have sufficient disk space, I recommend downloading your entire cloud storage data store, at least temporarily. Bring everything down and let Time Machine and your other backup systems make a copy. Then, if you want to recover the disk space, reset folders you don’t need to online-only. New files you create will be offline because you’re working on them, so they’ll automatically get into the backups.</p>
<p>Phew! When I started this article, I thought it would be a fairly short explanation of how the Dropbox folder had moved after migrating to the new File Provider extension. Three days of research and testing later, I think I’ve wrapped my head around all the details. But perhaps not! If you still have questions, ask them in the comments.</p>

				<tidbits:app_blurb><![CDATA[Over a year and a half after it acquired Primephonic, Apple has finally announced the release of the dedicated Apple Music Classic app for iOS, scheduled for 28 March 2023. You can “pre-order” the free app now.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>At TechCrunch, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/09/apple-launches-its-new-classical-music-streaming-app-for-pre-order/">Sarah Perez writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is launching a new music streaming service focused on classical music. Based on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/apple-buys-classical-music-service-primephonic/">2021 acquisition of Amsterdam-based streamer Primephonic</a>, the new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1598433714" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Music Classical app</a> will offer Apple Music subscribers access to over 5 million classical music tracks, including new releases in high-quality audio, as well as hundreds of curated playlists, thousands of exclusive albums, and other features like composer bios and deep dives on key works, Apple says.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>However, while the app is being announced today, it’s only available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1598433714" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order on the App Store</a> for now. The release date will be later this month, on March 28. In addition, the app will only support iOS devices running iOS 15.4 or newer at launch.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Verge’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/9/23632184/apple-classical-music-app-features-primephonic-ios-android-launch-date">Chris Welch adds</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple Music Classical will stream at up to 192 kHz/24-bit hi-res lossless, and Apple says it will include “thousands” of spatial audio recordings. Like Primephonic, it will offer thorough and accurate metadata — a challenge for services that cram all music genres into one destination — and you’ll be able to search “by composer, work, conductor, or even catalog number, and find specific recordings instantly.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It has been 19 months since Apple purchased Primephonic and promised a dedicated classical music app in 2022, but better late than never (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2021/08/31/apple-buys-classical-music-service-primephonic/">Apple Buys Classical Music Service Primephonic</a>,” 31 August 2021). We look forward to hearing how well Apple Music Classical manages the highly specific metadata preferred by classical music aficionados.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>On the Outlook blog, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/outlook-mac-for-all/ba-p/3757787">Jeremy Perdue writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now consumers can use Outlook for free on macOS, no Microsoft 365 subscription or license necessary. Whether at home, work or school, Mac users everywhere can easily add Outlook.com, Gmail, iCloud, Yahoo! or IMAP accounts in Outlook and experience the best mail and calendar app on macOS. The Outlook for Mac app complements Outlook for iOS – giving people a consistent, reliable, and powerful experience that brings the best-in-class experience of Outlook into the Apple ecosystem that so many love.</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used Outlook, but Tonya uses it in her work at Cornell and says it&#8217;s a capable app for email and calendaring. That said, SpamSieve author <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/03/07/microsoft-adds-free-outlook-tier/">Michael Tsai points out</a> that this free version—which he sees as a free tier of service—is ad-supported and requires the &#8220;New Outlook&#8221; user interface that has attracted criticism. Microsoft 365 subscribers don&#8217;t see ads and can <a href="https://forum.c-command.com/t/turning-off-new-outlook-in-outlook-16-58/14286">revert to the previous interface</a> using Terminal.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider before testing Outlook is that the app asks you to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sync-your-account-in-outlook-to-the-microsoft-cloud-985f9e19-d308-4e85-9d1d-0c6f32f8e981">sync all your data to the Microsoft Cloud</a> to enable features that are otherwise limited to Microsoft 365 subscribers or Microsoft Exchange Online accounts. (I think you can decline using the Sync Directly with Google link in the dialog below, but I couldn&#8217;t tell what happened afterward. I ended up going into my Google Account and <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">revoking permissions</a> from Microsoft.) It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t trust Microsoft—the company manages email for hundreds of millions of users—it&#8217;s that replicating all my data in another online location feels like adding an unnecessary point of vulnerability from a privacy and security perspective. I suppose it could be viewed as a backup, but if that&#8217;s the goal, I would back up locally instead of to another cloud location.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>As noted on <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/03/hello-yellow-apple-introduces-new-iphone-14-and-iphone-14-plus/">Apple’s Newsroom</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple today announced a new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, adding even more color choices to the lineup this spring.… The new yellow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available to pre-order this Friday, March 10, with availability starting Tuesday, March 14.</p></blockquote>
<p>The new yellow is pretty, as are some of the other colors. It remains a little off-putting that Apple doesn’t make the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in vibrant colors—Pro apparently means “boring.” But it’s all moot without a clear case that lets the iPhone color shine through—I had to take my iPhone 14 Pro out of its Smartish Wallet Slayer Vol. 1 case to remind myself what color it is (a sort of purplish-gray).</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>At Daring Fireball, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/tweetbot_and_twitterrific_face_the_cliff">John Gruber writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Twitter’s kneecapping of third-party clients didn’t just mean that their <em>future</em> revenue was gone — it meant <em>revenue they’d already collected</em> from App Store subscriptions would need to go back to customers in the form of prorated refunds for the remaining months on each and every user’s annual subscriptions. Consider the gut punch of losing your job — you stop earning income. It’s brutal. Now imagine that the way it worked when you get fired or laid off is that you’re also suddenly on the hook to pay back the last, say, 6 months of your income. That’s where Tapbots and The Iconfactory are.</p></blockquote>
<p>After Elon Musk pulled the plug on third-party Twitter clients without notice, the small companies behind Tweetbot and Twitterrific face an existential financial crisis brought on by the need to refund pro-rated subscriptions. If you subscribe to either app, I encourage you to consider opening it and tapping the “I don’t need a refund” button to help the developers. Tapbots also offers an option to transfer your subscription time to its Ivory client for Mastodon (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2023/01/27/mastodon-a-new-hope-for-social-networking/">Mastodon: A New Hope for Social Networking</a>,” 27 January 2023).</p>

				<tidbits:app_blurb><![CDATA[macOS has a long-standing bug that causes screen savers to fail to show edited or rotated images from Photos—only the original versions. Ventura still suffers from this problem, and although Adam Engst shares some workarounds, you’re not going to like them.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>In the days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Dark_(software)">After Dark</a>, near the start of TidBITS in the early 1990s, screen savers were a big deal—they regularly made news. After Dark was modular, supporting a fertile ecosystem of independent developers alongside licensed options from franchises like Star Trek, Disney, and Marvel Comics. Sadly, After Dark—and its iconic flying toasters—never made the leap to Mac OS 9. Although the package was revived for Mac OS X, it never regained anything resembling its previous glory (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2003/06/09/after-dark-returns-for-mac-os-x/">After Dark Returns for Mac OS X</a>,” 9 June 2003). If you want to refresh your visual memory of the core After Dark modules, see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2015/06/12/revisit-the-flying-toasters-via-css/">Revisit the Flying Toasters via CSS</a>” (12 June 2015).</p>
<p>By the early 2000s, the world had moved on, which Apple helped by giving Mac OS X its own modular screen saver capabilities, with screen savers that display either pretty patterns or selections from your photos. Apple’s Ken Burns screen saver, which pans and zooms through your photos, has been particularly popular, and the company has added numerous other photo-based screen savers to macOS over the years.</p>
<p>But therein lies the longstanding rub: an unresolved bug that spans many years. The big win of Apple’s photo screen savers is that they let you select photos from your Photos library or a folder. According to the author of <a href="http://www.cs.uni-bremen.de/~zach/software/ArtSaver/index.html">ArtSaver</a>, an independent macOS screen saver that offers many more options, Apple doesn’t allow third-party apps access to your Photos library.</p>
<p>What’s the bug? Let’s imagine that you’re my parents. (They’re special, but in this scenario, not unusual.) While digital picture frames are popular and ever larger—you can get affordable ones up to 15 inches—they still don’t compare to a 27-inch iMac. And there’s the trouble of managing albums and transferring them to a digital frame. Why wouldn’t you use your iMac to shuffle through decades of family photos already stored on your computer?</p>
<p>So you pick one of Apple’s basic photo screen savers—my parents are not fond of the flippy, zippy ones where photos bounce frenetically—and configure it to display the images from a particular album. That works fine until it hits a photo that was captured in portrait orientation and that you rotated to landscape in Photos. That photo still stubbornly displays in portrait orientation, not landscape, so the subject is on its side.</p>
<p>This is not a subtle bug, though when my parents complained about it, it took me a little while to figure out what was different about the affected images. The problem is simple: Apple’s photo screen savers display only original, unedited images in Photos. If you have edited an image, including rotating it, the screen saver ignores your changes, instead using the original image stored separately in Photos.</p>
<p>It’s no secret, but Photos stores your original images in a folder (called “originals”) within the Photos Library package. When you edit an image in the app, those changes are applied as a series of transformations rendered on top of the original and shown in preview in thumbnails. However, when the screen saver module references an album image, it doesn’t trigger what may be a computationally expensive operation to render the image as you’d see it in Photos. But few other apps should be consuming significant CPU cycles when the screen saver is active.</p>
<p>My parents are a few versions of macOS behind because they’re using a 27-inch iMac from 2014, which can’t be upgraded to macOS 12 Monterey, much less macOS 13 Ventura. But it took me only a few minutes to confirm that the bug still exists in Ventura. I copied a few photos into a new album, rotated a couple of them and made wildly obvious color edits to several others, and then tested that album in the various photo-based screen savers in System Settings &gt; Screen Saver. Clicking the Preview button showed that it was using the originals and not my rotated or edited versions.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/macOS-screen-savers.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61785" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/macOS-screen-savers.png" alt="Screen Saver settings pane in Ventura" width="1436" height="1100" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/macOS-screen-savers.png 1436w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/macOS-screen-savers-1280x981.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /></a></p>
<h2>Workarounds</h2>
<p>There are workarounds, but you’re not going to like them because they waste disk space and require regular maintenance to include new photos.</p>
<p>The first method requires you to export and reimport your edited photos so that the screen saver software sees them as “originals.” When you export edited images to the Finder, Photos “burns” the edits into the files, making them permanent. You can then reimport those images into Photos, either deleting the ones you exported to save space and reduce confusion, or keeping them for future edits, both of which are problematic.</p>
<p>This approach suffers from at least the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>It will be clumsy.</b> Although you can create a smart album that contains only edited photos for export, it will likely still collect oodles of images—nearly 7000 in my Photos library. When you reimport, consider importing into an album and applying a keyword so you can identify these images easily later.<br />
<a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Photos-smart-album-edited.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61786 alignnone" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Photos-smart-album-edited.png" alt="Photos smart album dialog" width="1272" height="348" /></a></li>
<li><b>You’ll need significant disk space temporarily.</b> Exporting and reimporting all those will take time and consume disk space, and unless you temporarily disable Time Machine and any online backup software like Backblaze, they could cause your backups to balloon in size as well.</li>
<li><b>Some metadata will be lost.</b> Although you can choose to export photo titles, captions, keywords, and locations, when exporting using File &gt; Export &gt; Export # Photos, you’ll lose album and project inclusions. Don’t just drag the photos to the Finder, or you’ll also lose titles, captions, and keywords.<br />
<a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Photos-export-dialog.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-61787 alignnone" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Photos-export-dialog.png" alt="Photos Export dialog" width="541" height="396" /></a></li>
<li><b>The imported images may be larger.</b> If your originals are in HEIF format, replacing them with JPEG versions will likely require more disk space. I started with a 3.2 MB original in HEIF and exported by dragging and by using the High and Maximum settings in the JPEG Quality pop-up menu. The High-quality export grew to 4.4 MB, the dragged image was 5.5 MB, and the Maximum-quality export was a whopping 12.4 MB. If you’re instead keeping the versions you exported for later editing, you could export images at the size of your screen to save space.<br />
<a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Photos-export-sizes-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61784 alignnone" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Photos-export-sizes-scaled.jpg" alt="Examples of exported photo sizes." width="2560" height="1191" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Photos-export-sizes-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Photos-export-sizes-1280x596.jpg 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Photos-export-sizes-1536x715.jpg 1536w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/03/Photos-export-sizes-2048x953.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></li>
<li><b>You won’t be able to revert anymore.</b> Of course, if you’re replacing your original images with exported and reimported versions, you won’t be able to use the Revert to Original command for such photos. That may not be an issue for those that were just rotated, but you might not appreciate losing history on more complex edits.</li>
<li><b>Duplicates could cause confusion.</b> If you decide to export at a lower resolution to save space and keep the originals when reimporting, you’ll end up with duplicates that may confuse other aspects of your Photos use.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m a purist about not throwing away data that could be useful later, so I’m highly uncomfortable with this workaround. The alternative of keeping both the originals and smaller imports makes me even more concerned about wasting space and dealing with duplicates.</p>
<p>Second, you could export only the photos you want your screen saver to display to a folder in the Finder and then point the screen saver at that folder. Even if you export images at just the resolution of your screen and with a tighter JPEG compression level, this workaround consumes a lot of disk space as well and requires even more work to maintain the folder manually with future exports rather than relying on an easily updated album or automatically updated smart album. It’s similarly unsatisfying.</p>
<p>My parents will likely just be annoyed at the incorrectly rotated photos in their screen saver until Apple fixes this bug. But given how many years it has existed, I’m not holding out hope that we’ll ever see it fixed. Personally, I’ll stick with the <a href="https://electricsheep.org/">Electric Sheep</a> screen saver I’ve liked for years, although the rabbit hole that I got sucked down while working on the introductory paragraph reminded me of the <a href="https://www.pure-mac.com/screensaver.html">Pure Mac Screen Savers</a>, <a href="https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/">XScreenSaver</a>, and <a href="https://www.screensaversplanet.com/screensavers/mac">Screensavers Planet</a> collections of screen savers. There’s lots of eye candy out there.</p>

				<tidbits:app_blurb><![CDATA[LastPass was heavily criticized for communicating insufficient details after it lost customer vault data in a breach. A collection of new posts attempt to rectify that mistake—but it’s not enough for Adam Engst, who shares his experiences switching from LastPass to 1Password.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>In 2022, password management service LastPass suffered its latest significant breach, this  one resulting in the loss of customer vault data (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2022/12/24/lastpass-shares-details-of-connected-security-breaches/">LastPass Shares Details of Security Breach</a>,” 24 December 2022). Months later, the company has finally provided significantly more information about the breach, what data was compromised, and how users should respond. The new information is helpful, but it doesn’t make me regret switching to 1Password.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2023/03/security-incident-update-recommended-actions/">carefully worded blog post</a>, LastPass CEO Karim Toubba lays out a more-detailed timeline of two chained incidents, with the <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/help/incident-1-additional-details-of-the-attack">first</a> setting the stage for the <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/help/incident-2-additional-details-of-the-attack">second</a>. He then points readers to a pair of security bulletins with recommended actions: one for <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/help/security-bulletin-recommended-actions-for-free-premium-and-families-customers">LastPass Free, Premium, and Families users</a> and another for <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/help/security-bulletin-recommended-actions-for-business-administrators">LastPass Business users</a>. Finally, he summarizes what actions LastPass has taken to <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/help/what-have-we-done-to-ensure-lastpass-is-safe-to-use">better secure its systems</a>. I particularly appreciated <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/help/what-data-was-accessed">the extensive list of all the data types accessed</a>, with notes about which fields were encrypted and which were not.</p>
<p>Notably, the company says that it hasn’t heard from the attacker nor seen any indication of the data being used.</p>
<blockquote><p>There has been no contact or demands made, and there has been no detected credible underground activity indicating that the threat actor is actively engaged in marketing or selling any information obtained during either incident.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you’re interested in security stuff, the various posts are worth reading, and LastPass has done a much better job of communicating this time, even if it’s overdue. In particular, if you’re still using LastPass, I recommend <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/help/security-bulletin-recommended-actions-for-free-premium-and-families-customers">following the company’s advice</a> to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the strength of your master password</li>
<li>Increase the number of password iterations</li>
<li>Turn on or reset multifactor authentication</li>
<li>Review the Security Dashboard</li>
<li>Turn on dark web monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p>LastPass hasn’t yet made the last two options available to LastPass Free users, but the company says it will enable them shortly. Interestingly, LastPass has dramatically increased the number of password iterations. Some long-time users were still set at what is now an absurdly low 5,000, while newer users had 100,000 iterations. The default is now 600,000—that’s a big change.</p>
<p>I wonder what Karim Toubba must be going through. He joined LastPass as CEO in April 2022, and the first breach occurred just months later, in August 2022. The company has likely been in crisis mode ever since, and the extent of the changes (combined with the actual breach, of course!) suggests that its previous security stance was problematic. We hope the adults are now in charge and are taking the right steps to prevent future breaches.</p>
<h2>Switching to 1Password from LastPass and Authy</h2>
<p>On top of my irritation with LastPass’s interface, functionality, and reliability, the breach was the final straw, so I switched to <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> and <a href="https://support.1password.com/import-lastpass/">imported my data from LastPass</a>. I chose the approach of exporting data from LastPass and importing it into 1Password because 1Password’s direct import capability doesn’t work if you have multifactor authentication turned on in LastPass. I wasn’t comfortable disabling that, even temporarily.</p>
<p>I’m not quite ready to delete all my data from LastPass, but that’s on my list once I’m confident that 1Password has all the capabilities I want. I realize that some people haven’t been happy with the changes in 1Password 8, but as someone who didn’t particularly use previous versions, I haven’t been perturbed. While not perfect, 1Password has been significantly more elegant than LastPass, which never provided anything resembling a native Mac or iOS experience. That was especially true in the last few weeks I used LastPass, when it felt like the company was making rapid changes in an effort to show users that it was doing something.</p>
<p>I particularly like using my Apple Watch to unlock 1Password on my 2020 27-inch iMac and my watch or Touch ID on my M1 MacBook Air. LastPass introduced app-based multifactor authentication a while back, but it never properly accepted input from its watchOS app, forcing me to pull out my iPhone every time to confirm login in its iOS app. I’ve subsequently reset LastPass’s multifactor authentication to use a normal time-based one-time password (TOTP) that I stored in 1Password, which auto-fills it whenever I log in to LastPass on my Mac—a distinct improvement over tapping a button in LastPass’s iPhone app.</p>
<p>1Password’s support for TOTP has been a big win. I started with authentication apps early, when Google Authenticator was the only game in town. When I learned that its data wouldn’t transfer to a new iPhone (it can now if you can scan a QR code on the old device), I switched to the free <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> ecosystem of apps, which has worked acceptably and syncs across my Macs, iPhone, and iPad. (I tried LastPass Authenticator briefly, but it’s available only for the iPhone and iPad, and I hate turning to my iPhone when logging in on the Mac.)</p>
<p>Authy provides the <a href="https://authy.com/download/">Authy Desktop</a> app for the Mac, but every time I want to log in to an account requiring two-factor authentication, I have to launch Authy Desktop, search for the website (I have 28 accounts), click a button to copy the code, switch back to my Web browser, and paste the code. I thought about automating the process with Keyboard Maestro, but it would be nothing more than fragile monkey-clicking. The way 1Password auto-fills the TOTP as the next step in the login process has been a huge relief.</p>
<p>(Glenn Fleishman reminds me that you could opt instead to use Apple’s multi-platform support for TOTPs, but on the Mac, it works only within Safari. If you use other Mac browsers or apps, you have to bring up Safari &gt; Preferences &gt; Passwords or the Passwords settings/preference pane, authenticate, search, click, and copy; see his article, “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2021/10/07/add-two-factor-codes-to-password-entries-in-ios-15-ipados-15-and-safari-15/">Add Two-Factor Codes to Password Entries in iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and Safari 15</a>,” 7 October 2021. And, of course, then there’s the whole iCloud Keychain vulnerability if your iPhone and passcode were stolen; see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2023/02/26/how-a-thief-with-your-iphone-passcode-can-ruin-your-digital-life/">How a Thief with Your iPhone Passcode Can Ruin Your Digital Life</a>,” 26 February 2023.)</p>
<p>Moving my two-factor authentication setup from Authy to 1Password has been fussy and time-consuming. Amazon Web Services was the only service that allowed me to register 1Password as an additional authentication device. For all other accounts, I’ve had to reset two-factor authentication or turn it off and back on. The threat of being completely locked out of an account is scary, so I’m careful to add the new TOTP to both 1Password and Authy (again) before I delete the old account in Authy. While I don’t anticipate using Authy after I get everything set up in 1Password, it feels like a useful backup if storing the TOTP in 1Password alongside the account credentials feels problematic. Remember to record one-time or “scratch” codes if a site offers them when enabling two-factor authentication—they can be a lifeline if you have a TOTP blowout.</p>
<p>Much as with the Wall Street Journal’s coverage of iPhone passcode thefts, I’ve come to see the LastPass breach as an opportunity to rethink my approach to password security. I wasn’t entirely happy with LastPass before the breach but couldn’t muster the enthusiasm for switching. By cleaning up duplicates and other cruft in 1Password organically, as I need to use the associated sites, I can nibble away at a task that would be too enormous to face all at once—I have over 900 logins. I’ll ultimately have a better handle on my passwords than ever before.</p>
<p>But I’ll still be happy if passkey support—see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2022/06/27/why-passkeys-will-be-simpler-and-more-secure-than-passwords/">Why Passkeys Will Be Simpler and More Secure Than Passwords</a>,” 27 June 2022—becomes widespread quickly such that I don’t need all these stinkin’ passwords!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered what really happens to the old running shoes I toss into the donation box at my local running store, and now I know how to find out—embed an AirTag in them! I would also include an explanatory note to encourage contact in case it was found instead of being shredded for recycling. It might be an amusing way to meet a runner in another part of the world.</p>

				<tidbits:app_blurb><![CDATA[The Wall Street Journal reports on a spate of attacks in which iPhone thieves obtain your passcode and then change your Apple ID password, disable Find My, make purchases with Apple Pay, and more. Some attacks are as simple as the miscreants surreptitiously watching you enter your passcode; others involve violence. Read on to learn how to protect yourself.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>Joanna Stern and Nicole Nguyen of the Wall Street Journal have published <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-iphone-security-theft-passcode-data-privacya-basic-iphone-feature-helps-criminals-steal-your-digital-life-cbf14b1a">an article</a> (paywalled) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUYODQB_2wQ">accompanying video</a> that describes a troubling spate of attacks reported by individuals and police departments aimed at iPhone users that may involve hundreds to thousands of victims per year in the United States.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Apple’s iPhone Passcode Problem: Thieves Can Ruin Your Entire Digital Life in Minutes | WSJ" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QUYODQB_2wQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Watch the video, but in short, a ne’er-do-well gets someone in a bar to enter their iPhone passcode while they surreptitiously observe (or a partner does it for them). Then the thief steals the iPhone and dashes off. Within minutes, the thief has used the passcode to gain access to the iPhone and change the Apple ID password, which enables them to disable Find My, make purchases using Apple Pay, gain access to passwords stored in iCloud Keychain, and scan through Photos for pictures of documents that contain a Social Security number or other details that could be used for identify theft. After that, they may transfer money from bank accounts, apply for an Apple Card, and more, all while the user is completely locked out of their account.</p>
<p>And yes, they’ll wipe and resell the iPhone too. Almost no crimes like this have been reported by Android users, with a police officer speculating that it was because the resale value of Android phones is lower. In the video, Joanna Stern said a thief with the passcode to an Android phone could perform similar feats of identity and financial theft.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal article details three kinds of attacks, only one of which is clearly avoidable. The one that’s heavily emphasized in the article I describe above. But Stern and Nguyen also spoke to victims who were drugged—<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/06/27/metro/fears-drugged-drinks-boston-bars-are-widespread-growing/">a sadly common problem</a>—and interviewed others who were subjected to violence to reveal their code. In no case have the victims done anything wrong, and anyone who frequents bars or similar venues in urban areas should beware.</p>
<p>Given the high profile of the Wall Street Journal coverage, I fully expect Apple to address this vulnerability in iOS 17, if not before. The obvious solution is to require the user to enter the current Apple ID password before allowing it to be changed in Settings &gt; <i>Your Name</i> &gt; Password &amp; Security &gt; Change Password. That won’t block access to iCloud Keychain, but at least it would let the user wipe the iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple probably hasn’t prompted for the current Apple ID password in the past because the passcode is considered a secure second factor—you have the iPhone, and you know the passcode. In contrast, when you log in to the <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage">Apple ID</a> site to manage your account, you must provide your current password, go through two-factor authentication, and enter the current password again to change it. It seems like an easy change to make, at least until Apple has had a chance to think through other options.</p>
<p>The closest we have to an additional password step is a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201304">Screen Time passcode</a>. If you enable Screen Time, set a separate four-digit Screen Time passcode, turn on Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions, and select Account Changes &gt; Don’t Allow, no one can change your Apple ID password without that passcode. Unfortunately, it prevents you from even entering Settings &gt; <em>Your Name</em> without first going to Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions &gt; Account Changes &gt; <em>####</em> &gt; Allow. Most people wouldn’t put up with such a speed bump.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Screen-Time-passcode-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61711" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Screen-Time-passcode-scaled.jpg" alt="Screen Time passcode protection from account changes" width="2560" height="2539" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Screen-Time-passcode-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Screen-Time-passcode-1280x1270.jpg 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Screen-Time-passcode-1536x1524.jpg 1536w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Screen-Time-passcode-2048x2032.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></p>
<p>Another flaw that Stern and Nguyen note is that Apple’s new hardware security key option, if enabled, doesn’t always prompt for the hardware key when making changes if the user has the device passcode (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2023/01/23/apple-releases-ios-16-3-ipados-16-3-and-macos-13-2-ventura-with-hardware-security-key-support/">Apple Releases iOS 16.3, iPadOS 16.3, and macOS 13.2 Ventura with Hardware Security Key Support</a>,” 23 January 2023). The security key protection can be entirely removed, too, without having one of the hardware keys. Apple should re-evaluate how this high-security option—albeit one only a subset of users will employ—lives up to its promises.</p>
<h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>
<p>You might think you would never be the victim of a watch-snatch-and-grab theft, being drugged at a bar or on a date, or a violent crime. But the theft of a passcode can happen in other circumstances. And it has such severe consequences, as the Wall Street Journal reporters noted, that even if you’re not a barfly or live in an area with a high incidence of violent property theft, I think everyone should take stock of these ways to deter malicious use of their passcode:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pay attention to your iPhone’s physical security in public.</b> These attacks require both your passcode and physical possession of your iPhone. Many of us have become blasé about exposing our iPhones in public because we use them constantly and because everyone else has smartphones as well. Apple has also done a great job with the message that an iPhone is useless to a thief due to a passcode protecting its contents and Activation Lock ensuring it can’t be resold intact—this probably makes us less concerned about its security even if there’s a hassle and expense in replacing it. There’s no good way to prevent a thief from grabbing the iPhone from your hand when you’re using it, but if you can keep it in a pocket or purse when it’s not in use, rather than holding it or leaving it on the table in front of you, that reduces the chance that a thief will target you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Always use Face ID or Touch ID in public.</b> The key to these attacks is acquiring the user’s passcode; the easy way to do that is to observe or record you entering it. If you rely entirely on Face ID or Touch ID, particularly when in public, no one can steal your passcode without you knowing. (Police believe those who are drugged while drinking have their faces or fingers used, but that doesn’t reveal their passcodes.) If you have been avoiding Face ID or Touch ID based on some misguided belief about the security of your biometric information, I implore you to use it. Your fingerprint or facial information is <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/face-id-and-touch-id-security-sec067eb0c9e/1/web/1">stored solely on the device</a> in the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/1/web/1">Secure Enclave</a>, which is much more secure than passcode entry in nearly all circumstances. If you are one of the few people for whom Face ID or Touch ID works poorly, conceal your passcode from anyone who might be watching, just as you would when entering your PIN at an ATM.</li>
<li><b>Consider a stronger passcode:</b> By default, iPhone passcodes are six digits. You can downgrade to four digits, which is a bad idea, but you can also upgrade to a longer alphanumeric passcode. In the video, Joanna Stern recommends that, and it might make it harder for someone to observe surreptitiously, but I’m unconvinced the increased security would be worth the added effort. Someone could still record you entering your alphanumeric passcode, and the longer and harder it is to enter, the more time it will take and the more focused you will be on typing it correctly, making you less aware of your surroundings. (Interestingly, if you set an alphanumeric passcode with just digits, you still get a numeric keypad to enter it, whereas if you add non-numeric characters, you have to use the full keyboard.) Still, I can’t recommend most people go beyond a standard six-digit passcode. Just make sure it’s not something trivially easy to observe or guess, like 111111 or 123456.<br />
<a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/passcode-options-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61690 alignnone" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/passcode-options-scaled.jpg" alt="iPhone passcode options" width="2560" height="2539" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/passcode-options-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/passcode-options-1280x1270.jpg 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/passcode-options-1536x1524.jpg 1536w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/passcode-options-2048x2032.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></li>
<li><b>Never share your passcode beyond trusted family members.</b> If you wouldn’t give someone complete access to your bank account, don’t give them your passcode. If extreme circumstances require you to trust a person outside that circle temporarily, change the passcode to something simple they’ll remember—even 123456—and change it back as soon as they return your iPhone.</li>
<li><b>Use a third-party password manager instead of iCloud Keychain.</b> It pains me to recommend this option because Apple keeps improving the interface to iCloud Keychain with Settings &gt; Passwords and System Settings/Preferences &gt; Passwords. But until the operating systems protect access to iCloud Keychain passwords with more than the passcode, relying on iCloud Keychain is just not safe enough. In contrast, third-party password managers secure your passwords with a separate password. Even if they support and you enable biometric unlocking, the fallback is the password manager’s account password, not the device passcode.<br />
<a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/1Password-Face-ID-fail-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61691 alignnone" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/1Password-Face-ID-fail-scaled.jpg" alt="1Password Face ID unlock failure" width="2560" height="2539" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/1Password-Face-ID-fail-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/1Password-Face-ID-fail-1280x1270.jpg 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/1Password-Face-ID-fail-1536x1524.jpg 1536w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/1Password-Face-ID-fail-2048x2032.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></li>
<li><b>Delete photos containing SSNs or other identification numbers.</b> It’s common to take a photo of your Social Security card, driver’s license, or passport as a backup, just in case you lose the real thing. That’s not a bad idea, but storing such images in Photos leaves them vulnerable to these attacks. Instead, store them in your password manager. Search in Photos on <code>SSN</code>, <code>TIN</code>, <code>EIN</code>, <code>driver’s license</code>, and <code>passport</code>, along with your actual Social Security and other identification numbers. Also search on <code>Visa</code>, <code>MasterCard</code>, <code>Discover</code>, <code>American Express</code>, and the names of any other credit cards you might have photographed as a backup. (Searching for text in Photos works in macOS 13 Ventura and iOS 16. For older operating system versions, try <a href="https://photos-search.com/index.html">Photos Search</a>; see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2021/08/23/work-with-text-in-images-with-textsniper-and-photos-search/">Work with Text in Images with TextSniper and Photos Search</a>,” 23 August 2021.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Response</h2>
<p>I’m putting my time where my mouth is. Even though I’m at a very low risk for these attacks, which primarily target bar-goers in large cities and people in areas with frequent street crime, I’ve taken steps to reduce my exposure.</p>
<p>First, I already rely on Face ID whenever possible, and I’ll be even more aware of who’s watching while entering my passcode if Face ID fails and I’m forced to tap in my secret digits. I’m already slightly embarrassed to have my iPhone out when I’m in public when I’m not using it, and I’ll probably keep it in my pocket even more than I used to.</p>
<p>Second, I decided to clear out all my iCloud Keychain-stored passwords. On my MacBook Air, I went to System Settings &gt; Passwords, selected all of them, and pressed Delete. (You can also do this in Safari’s Passwords settings pane.) Because I have never seriously used iCloud Keychain, this was no hardship—everything in there was essentially random. Until recently, I used LastPass, but after LastPass’s breach, I switched to 1Password and imported all my LastPass passwords (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2022/12/24/lastpass-shares-details-of-connected-security-breaches/">LastPass Shares Details of Security Breach</a>,” 24 December 2022). I had a lot of passwords already stored in 1Password from various imports and tests over the years, plus the vaults I share with Tonya and Tristan. Whenever I use a password now, I take a few minutes to clean up duplicates and related cruft, like leftover autogenerated passwords.</p>
<p>I realize those who rely on iCloud Keychain won’t be comfortable deleting their passwords, but I can say that I found it simple to switch to 1Password from LastPass, and 1Password offers <a href="https://support.1password.com/import-safari/">instructions for exporting iCloud Keychain passwords and importing into 1Password</a>. Do the export/import dance and live with 1Password—or whatever password manager you choose—for a week or two to make sure it’s working for you before deleting everything from iCloud Keychain. If you decide to return to iCloud Keychain in the future, <a href="https://simonbs.dev/posts/moving-from-1password-to-icloud-keychain/">that’s possible too</a>.</p>
<p>Third, I visually browsed and used text searches in my Photos library for identification cards and the like, exporting a few for import into 1Password and deleting everything afterward. (Remember that Photos stores deleted images in the Recently Deleted album for about 30 days before deleting them permanently. To remove them immediately, select the photos in that album and hit Delete.) I found my driver’s license, passport, credit cards, insurance cards, and other cards from my wallet. Make sure to click See All after performing a Photos search if there are more than a handful of results. I even searched on <code>card</code> and scrolled through 500-odd photos to find a few that escaped other searches. (Who knew I took so many photos containing cardboard?)</p>
<p>I briefly considered moving those sensitive images to the Hidden album in Photos and using the new iOS 16/Ventura option to protect that album with Face ID or Touch ID. Unfortunately, when I tested multiple Face ID failures on my iPhone, I was eventually prompted for my passcode, which revealed the Hidden album. It’s another example of how the passcode is the key to your kingdom.</p>
<p>While the chance of any given person falling prey to this sort of attack is vanishingly small, and I’m not actually worried for myself, the Wall Street Journal reporting led me to think about and clean up my broader security assumptions and behavior. I appreciated the nudge, and I’d encourage you to reflect on your security situation as well.</p>

				<tidbits:app_blurb><![CDATA[Curious about how Time Machine snapshots can supposedly prevent the space occupied by deleted files from being recovered right away, Adam Engst ran some tests and came away more confused than when he started.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>Howard Oakley’s explanations of the underpinnings of macOS are always interesting, but his latest post on his Eclectic Light Company blog, “<a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2023/02/24/how-to-get-the-trash-working-properly/">How to get the Trash working properly</a>,” particularly drew my attention. In it, he points out that deleting a very large file to free up space doesn’t necessarily have the desired effect, at least right away.</p>
<p>The reason, he says, is that Time Machine works by making APFS snapshots of your entire drive on every backup and retaining those for 24 hours. Because one of those snapshots contains the very large file, you may not get the space back until a full day later, when Time Machine has deleted those snapshots to make way for new ones.</p>
<p>Oakley says that some backup apps use a similar approach—he calls out Carbon Copy Cloner—but unlike Time Machine, such apps generally provide options to disable the feature, change how long snapshots are retained, and delete the snapshots if you need the space right away. Time Machine has no such options, but you can delete the snapshots manually in Disk Utility. (Still other backup apps, such as Arq and Backblaze, don’t use APFS snapshots but consume significant amounts of space for caching purposes—that’s getting some <a href="https://talk.tidbits.com/t/how-much-cache-space-do-your-backup-clients-burn/21365?u=ace">discussion in TidBITS Talk</a> right now.)</p>
<p>I’ve been pondering just how difficult—perhaps impossible—it is to know how much free space you actually have on a Mac’s drive these days (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2022/11/15/ensure-sufficient-free-space-before-upgrading-to-ventura/">Ensure Sufficient Free Space before Upgrading to Ventura</a>,” 15 November 2022 and “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2023/01/11/iphones-and-ipads-now-require-a-passcode-on-every-backup-sync/">iPhones and iPads Now Require a Passcode on Every Backup/Sync</a>,” 11 January 2023). The complexity underlying APFS and macOS in general creates a situation where the amount of free space isn’t entirely deterministic. Howard Oakley examines the variables in “<a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/12/04/explainer-disk-free-space/">Explainer: Disk free space</a>,” and Jeff Carlson explains APFS in his <a href="https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/digital-storage/?pt=TIDBITS"><i>Take Control of Your Digital Storage, Second Edition</i></a> ebook.</p>
<p>I decided to see if I could replicate some of these issues, at least in macOS 12 Monterey, which I’m still running on my 2020 27-inch iMac until I find the time to do a much-needed clean installation of macOS 13 Ventura. I recently upgraded to V2 of the Affinity suite (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2022/12/05/consider-switching-from-creative-cloud-to-affinity-v2/">Consider Switching from Creative Cloud to Affinity V2</a>,” 5 December 2022), but I hadn’t gotten around to trashing the earlier versions of the Affinity apps. They’re about 2.5 GB each, and I put them in the Trash yesterday. This morning, Get Info on my boot drive reported 137 GB free, and the Trash contained 7.6 GB.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-1.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61685" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-1.png" alt="Free space at the start of the test" width="2182" height="1628" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-1.png 2182w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-1-1280x955.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-1-1536x1146.png 1536w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-1-2048x1528.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2182px) 100vw, 2182px" /></a></p>
<p>I figured that if I emptied the Trash, I’d either see no change due to the Time Machine snapshot issue or have almost exactly 145 GB free. Surprisingly, neither was true. After a minute or so, the free space number did rise—as expected—but first to 148 GB (not shown) before settling down at 146 GB. I can’t explain why it was a full gigabyte higher than would seem possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-2.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61684" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-2.png" alt="Free space after emptying Trash" width="2178" height="1628" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-2.png 2178w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-2-1280x957.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-2-1536x1148.png 1536w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-2-2048x1531.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2178px) 100vw, 2178px" /></a></p>
<p>So, for whatever reason, I was not seeing what Howard Oakley was describing. That’s good, I suppose, since his scenario was going to cause confusion for users. Nonetheless, I wanted to see what role those Time Machine snapshots played in the free space available on my drive. When I looked in Disk Utility, I had 24 snapshots, nominally consuming 36 GB. (By the time I took the screenshot below, I had already deleted two individual snapshots without making any difference in the amount of free space.)</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-3.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61683" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-3.png" alt="Deleting Time Machine snapshots in Disk Utility" width="2342" height="1282" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-3.png 2342w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-3-1280x701.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-3-1536x841.png 1536w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-3-2048x1121.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2342px) 100vw, 2342px" /></a></p>
<p>Regardless, when I selected all the snapshots and clicked the – button below the list, my free space number rose again, first to 163 GB (below left) and then, five minutes later, to 167 GB (below right). I’m somewhat perturbed that it changed so significantly over five minutes, but it may take that long for APFS to recalculate. However, since I had been at 146 GB free before, I would have expected it to rise to 182 GB. I can’t even begin to explain why it rose by only 21 GB.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-4.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61682" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-4.png" alt="Free space after removing Time Machine snapshots, and again 5 minutes later" width="2172" height="1628" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-4.png 2172w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-4-1280x959.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-4-1536x1151.png 1536w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-4-2048x1535.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2172px) 100vw, 2172px" /></a></p>
<p>Grasping at straws, I decided to restart, just in case that somehow helped the filesystem come to a better conclusion about the amount of free space. Unfortunately, after my Mac came back up (with the same apps running), the free space number had <i>dropped</i> to 159 GB. Inexplicable!</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-5.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-61681" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Free-space-5.png" alt="Free space dropped after restarting" width="320" height="487" /></a></p>
<p>Unless things have changed significantly in Ventura—my M1 MacBook Air isn’t a good testbed for this scenario—I no longer believe it’s possible to audit the free space on a Mac or to explain precisely how much space should be freed up by a particular action. Call it the APFS Uncertainty Principle (in which APFS expands to Absolutely Perplexing Fluctuating Space). Therefore, my advice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unless you’re simply curious, don’t waste time and mental energy trying to determine why deleting files or snapshots doesn’t free up the amount of space you think it should. macOS has become more complex than in past years, and the numbers no longer add up.</li>
<li>More so than ever before, do not let your boot drive get low on free space. You may be prevented from working until you jump through space-clearing hoops that might be time-consuming and inconvenient.</li>
<li>When buying a new Mac, choose an SSD with sufficient headroom for your data to grow. For instance, if you’re pushing the limits of a 512 GB SSD, get the 1 TB SSD on your next Mac, even if doubling your storage seems like overkill. Data never shrinks. (Besides, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1483183/ssd-speeds-m2-macbook-pro-mac-mini.html">the smallest SSDs may be half the speed of larger ones</a> due to using a single NAND chip instead of two NAND chips.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Have you had to go to great lengths to free up space on your Mac? Let us know in the comments what you tried and how it worked.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Five months ago, the <a href="https://stevejobsarchive.com/">Steve Jobs Archive</a> debuted (for our coverage, see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2022/09/09/steve-jobs-archive/">Steve Jobs Archive</a>,” 9 September 2022). Executive Director Leslie Berlin has now broken the silence since launch with <a href="https://mailchi.mp/7a6bd426b691/take-a-closer-look">an email containing the story behind a February 1984 photo of Steve Jobs</a>, captivated by the sight of one of the first Macs in the wild.</p>

<p>Remember, Apple had introduced the Macintosh to the world in the now-famous “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_(advertisement)">1984</a>” commercial during Super Bowl XVIII on 22 January 1984, and Jobs had pulled the first Macintosh out of its bag on 24 January 1984. The Mac couldn’t have been available for more than about a month. And Jobs isn’t even in Silicon Valley—he’s in New Orleans for a software conference, walking to dinner with a friend. Who wouldn’t be captivated by such a serendipitous sight?</p>

If only it weren’t so sensitive to light.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>When videoconferencing became the norm during the pandemic, we all became aware of a basic problem with webcams—even when you’re looking at the other person’s image on your screen, the webcam that actually records where you’re looking is somewhere else, making it difficult to maintain eye contact. On Macs, the webcam always sits above the display, so when you’re looking at the other person, they usually see you looking down instead. And if you don’t center the video window, you can also appear to be looking off to the side. In this example, I’ve put the video window in the bottom right corner of my iMac’s screen. Terrible idea.</p>
<figure id="attachment_61667" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-61667" style="width: 967px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/iMac-down-and-right.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61667" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/iMac-down-and-right.jpg" alt="iMac FaceTime HD camera example showing eye contact when looking at the bottom right of the screen" width="967" height="548" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-61667" class="wp-caption-text">iMac FaceTime HD camera example showing eye contact when looking at the bottom right of the screen</figcaption></figure>
<p>The best workaround is to shrink the other person’s preview and position it at the top of your screen, right under the webcam. That way, when you watch the other person’s face, you’ll appear to be looking right at them. You can help yourself remember to do this by writing “Look at me!” on a sticky note and attaching it to the top of the display, just above the webcam. (I also recommend hiding your own preview if you’re an accidental narcissist like me and can’t avoid looking at yourself.)</p>
<figure id="attachment_61668" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-61668" style="width: 968px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/iMac-top-and-center.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61668" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/iMac-top-and-center.jpg" alt="iMac FaceTime HD camera example showing eye contact when looking at the top center of the screen" width="968" height="549" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-61668" class="wp-caption-text">iMac FaceTime HD camera example showing eye contact when looking at the top center of the screen</figcaption></figure>
<p>“Surely there’s a higher-tech solution to this digital awkwardness,” you’re thinking. Machine-learning solutions can artificially adjust your eyeballs, at least beyond the Mac. On the iPhone, you can turn on Eye Contact for FaceTime calls (Settings &gt; FaceTime &gt; Eye Contact), but it works only on the iPhone XS or later, running iOS 14 or later, and only when using FaceTime. It can also be…a little creepy. For Windows PCs with Nvidia graphics cards, the Nvidia Broadcast app has an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/jan-2023-nvidia-broadcast-update/">Eye Contact feature </a>that a video editor unnervingly used to make <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/26/23572459/ai-eye-contact-tech-nvidia-movie-edit-clips">movie characters stare at you during their scenes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-vertical.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-61666" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-vertical.jpg" alt="CenterCam product shot" width="320" height="763" /></a>But we’re trying to bridge the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a>, not dive into it, and that’s what makes the <a href="https://thecentercam.com/">Center Cam</a> interesting. Billing itself as “The World’s Middle-Screen Webcam,” it’s a tiny video camera on a thin gooseneck stalk with a clip that attaches to the top of your display.</p>
<p>Inventor Ian Foster came up with the idea while doing an internship as part of his master’s degree in social work counseling during the pandemic. The rapport he had built in person with his youth clients fizzled once they were forced to move to remote counseling, partly due to the inability to maintain the eye contact essential for establishing trust. His solution was to design a webcam that was small enough to go in the middle of the screen during a video call.</p>
<p>Although the guts of a webcam aren’t all that large, most standalone webcams are a few inches wide, and putting that much hardware in the middle of the screen would be awkward at best and problematic in terms of how much of the display it would obscure at worst. They would also likely require a thicker stalk that would cover even more of the screen.</p>
<h2>Center Cam Hardware</h2>
<p>The Center Cam is a 0.60-inch (15 mm) cube, with a 0.40-inch (10 mm) round lens on the front. It hangs from a gooseneck stalk that you can bend however you want. The stalk is 16 inches (40 cm) long and 0.25 inches (6 mm) thick, providing plenty of positioning flexibility without getting in the way more than necessary. The gooseneck snaps into a slot on the clip to secure it in place and then feeds through the back of the clip, which you attach to your display. Most people will probably have the gooseneck come down from the top, but another approach might be to clip it on the side of the display and bend the gooseneck so it starts horizontally and then turns down.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-installed-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-61671" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-installed-scaled.jpg" alt="Two ways to install the Center Cam" width="2560" height="1686" srcset="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-installed-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-installed-1280x843.jpg 1280w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-installed-1536x1011.jpg 1536w, https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-installed-2048x1349.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></p>
<p>The spring-loaded clip expands to 2 inches (5 cm) wide, enough to clamp onto most screens. It has a ridged, rubbery material on the inside of the clip to ensure that it doesn’t scratch the display’s glass, and the tension is strong enough to hold it in place but not so strong that you have to worry about damaging the screen. I had no issues attaching it to either my 27-inch iMac or my 27-inch Thunderbolt Display, both of which have bezels that make it easy to keep the clip outside the functional area of the display. Although I didn’t use it for real with a laptop, the MacBook Air’s thinner top bezel forced me to position the clip lower, obscuring some of the top of the screen.</p>
<p>I found that the best location for the Center Cam was vertically down the left bezel of my iMac’s screen, next to my 27-inch Thunderbolt Display. That way, I could position the Center Cam in the dead space between my two screens, which worked well when I put a video call window up against the side of the display next to the Center Cam. For those with only one screen, it’s easy to move the Center Cam off to the side or remove it entirely when you’re not on a video call.</p>
<p>It’s important to realize that the clip is symmetrical, with another slot on the back. You’ll want to snap the rear portion of the gooseneck into the back slot to keep the weight of the gooseneck from pulling the clip off center. Even so, if the clip lists to the side, bending the gooseneck in the back can even out the forces to keep it straight.</p>
<p>The Center Cam sports a 1080p camera with 30 frames-per-second video. (Don’t get too excited—<a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207347086-Using-Group-HD-video">Zoom</a> and some other videoconferencing systems often drop the resolution to 720p or even lower.) It has an ƒ2.1 lens and a 65º horizontal field of view, and it comes with a little lens cap for those who want to be certain that it can’t be used for covert video. The lens rotates to focus manually, so you can adjust it if necessary (apparently, it could shift during shipping). Mine was fine out of the box, and after playing with the focus briefly, I’ve left it alone.</p>
<p>The cable that snakes through the gooseneck is roughly 42 inches (106 cm) long, so you shouldn’t have any trouble connecting it to a USB port. It has a USB-A plug and requires only USB 2.0, though it also includes a USB-C adapter for newer Macs.</p>
<p>Once connected, the Center Cam appears to apps as a normal video input option called “CC HD webcam.” It also has its own microphone, cleverly called “SPCA2281B2 Camera,” which I haven’t used much. It works, but it’s not great, and I prefer the AirPods Pro.</p>
<h2>The Future’s So Bright, You Gotta Wear Shades</h2>
<p>Here’s where I’d like to say that I adore the Center Cam and have switched all my video calling to it. Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case.</p>
<p>The entire point of the Center Cam is that it enables you to look better to other people, specifically by helping you maintain eye contact. It works well for that purpose, and when I asked people on calls if they could tell that I was using a camera that helped with eye contact, they all said yes.</p>
<p>The problem is that the Center Cam is extremely light-sensitive. On the one hand, that’s good because it means that it works well in low-light situations. (Ironically, the <a href="https://thecentercam.com/products/center-cam-deluxe-package">Center Cam Deluxe</a> package includes a ring light clip instead of the standard clip—it’s hard to imagine needing it.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re near a window or need an overhead light for other purposes, the image can be overexposed. From the eye-contact perspective, the image below is great, but the overhead light blows out my hair. And not in a good way.</p>
<figure id="attachment_61669" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-61669" style="width: 969px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-light-window.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61669" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-light-window.jpg" alt="Center Cam example with the overhead light on and the window shades open" width="969" height="545" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-61669" class="wp-caption-text">Center Cam example with the overhead light on and the window shades open</figcaption></figure>
<p>For comparison, here’s the same image taken with the iMac’s FaceTime HD camera. The FaceTime HD camera has a much wider field of view than the Center Cam, so you can see a lot more of the room around me. Plus, light and color are better balanced in the FaceTime HD camera&#8217;s image.</p>
<figure id="attachment_61674" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-61674" style="width: 968px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/iMac-day-light.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-61674 size-full" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/iMac-day-light.jpg" alt="iMac FaceTime HD camera example with the overhead light on and the window shades open" width="968" height="549" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-61674" class="wp-caption-text">iMac FaceTime HD camera example with the overhead light on and the window shades open</figcaption></figure>
<p>To bring down the halo effect on my hair, I turned off the overhead light. That dimmed the room, but not problematically so, as long as I didn’t need to read anything on paper. In the image below, my hair looks reasonable, and my skin is a more natural color, but the side of my face is over-illuminated by the window to my right.</p>
<figure id="attachment_61670" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-61670" style="width: 967px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-just-window.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61670" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-just-window.jpg" alt="Center Cam with no overhead light but the window shades open" width="967" height="546" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-61670" class="wp-caption-text">Center Cam example with no overhead light but the window shades open</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, I dropped the shades, which made the room significantly darker than I like. Using the Mac wasn’t a problem—I’m a touch typist—but I couldn’t work with anything else on my desk. The image below is quite a lot better, however, with decent skin color and even lighting.</p>
<figure id="attachment_61673" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-61673" style="width: 967px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-shades.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61673" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-shades.jpg" alt="Center Cam with the overhead light off and the window shades drawn" width="967" height="545" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-61673" class="wp-caption-text">Center Cam with the no overhead light and the window shades drawn</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the image above, most of the light on my face comes from the screen itself, which was largely white due to the documents I was using. But that’s easily avoided with a clever utility called <a href="https://hazeover.com/">HazeOver</a> that dims the windows of all but the frontmost app to reduce distractions. Using HazeOver to black out everything but the Zoom preferences window significantly reduced the light on my face but made the Mac harder to use.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to adjust the Center Cam’s image somewhat with another utility called <a href="https://www.ecamm.com/mac/iglasses/">iGlasses</a>. It can control the Center Cam’s exposure and brightness, along with temperature, tint, saturation, contrast, gamma, sharpness, and white balance. I played with it a bit but didn’t feel I’d made the image better enough to continue.</p>
<p>For comparison, here’s another shot from the iMac’s FaceTime HD camera with the overhead light off and the shades drawn—it’s much darker than the equivalent Center Cam image just above.</p>

<p>What about nighttime, which is when I do a lot of my Zoom meetings? I need the overhead light in my office on, which causes the Center Cam to overexpose my hair again, and generally gives the image a much warmer tone.</p>
<figure id="attachment_61664" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-61664" style="width: 980px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-night-light.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61664" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/Center-Cam-night-light.jpg" alt="Center Cam example with the overhead light on at night" width="980" height="553" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-61664" class="wp-caption-text">Center Cam example with the overhead light on at night</figcaption></figure>
<p>In comparison, the iMac’s FaceTime HD camera’s version of the shot looks quite similar to its daytime image.</p>
<figure id="attachment_61663" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-61663" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/iMac-night-light.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-61663" src="https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/02/iMac-night-light.jpg" alt="iMac FaceTime HD camera example with the overhead light on at night" width="970" height="546" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-61663" class="wp-caption-text">iMac FaceTime HD camera example with the overhead light on at night</figcaption></figure>
<p>I may be overthinking all this. However, in practice, what often happens when I’m using the Center Cam is that I connect to a Zoom call at the scheduled time, turn on the video, and am immediately unhappy with my preview. Rather than burn meeting time fiddling with the room lighting so the Center Cam’s image looks better, I switch to my iMac’s FaceTime HD camera, which provides a good image regardless of the room lighting.</p>
<p>But that’s just me. For some people and situations, eye contact is more important than overall image quality, which is hard to guarantee with videoconferencing anyway. If you’re looking for a webcam that will help you maintain eye contact during video calls, the Center Cam is worth considering. Its approach of putting the camera precisely at your eye level in the middle of your screen works well and doesn’t obscure more of the screen than is necessary. Although I wouldn’t recommend it if your office has a lot of windows, it’s ideal for anyone who works in dark surroundings. At $119.99, the <a href="https://thecentercam.com/products/center-cam-standard-package">Center Cam</a> costs more than standard webcams, but that’s the tradeoff for its unique industrial design.</p>
