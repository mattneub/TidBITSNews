				<tidbits:app_blurb><![CDATA[JPMorgan Chase has reached a deal to take over the Apple Card program from Goldman Sachs, ending the investment bank’s costly experiment in consumer lending.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>In the Wall Street Journal, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/jpmorgan-chase-reaches-a-deal-to-take-over-the-apple-credit-card-4e214fb2">AnnaMaria Andriotis and Gina Heeb write</a> (paywalled; <a href="https://apple.news/AAzNXt77ATV2x9xX1DiFptg">Apple News+ link</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>JPMorgan Chase has reached a deal to take over the Apple credit-card program from Goldman Sachs, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The biggest bank in the country will become the new issuer of the tech-giant’s credit card, one of the largest co-branded programs with some $20 billion in balances, in a deal that has been negotiated for more than a year.</p>
<p>The deal, which is expected to be announced soon barring any more last minute hiccups, will further cement JPMorgan’s status as a behemoth in the credit-card sector and marks the final chapter of Goldman’s failed experiment in consumer lending.</p></blockquote>
<p>It was only a matter of time before Apple found a company to replace Goldman Sachs, which has been trying to exit consumer lending since 2022. The Wall Street Journal reports that Goldman has lost over $7 billion since the beginning of 2020. Apparently, the deal with JPMorgan Chase took so long to negotiate due to “a high exposure to subprime borrowers and what has been a higher-than-industry-average delinquency rate.” I wouldn’t have expected that of the Apple Card.</p>
<p>JPMorgan will reportedly issue Apple Cards to new and existing cardholders, suggesting we’ll see new cards arrive in the mail, though the transition will take some time. JPMorgan also plans to open a new Apple Savings account, and existing Apple Savings account holders with Goldman can keep their accounts or open a new one with JPMorgan.</p>

				<tidbits:app_blurb><![CDATA[If your Mac apps keep opening on the wrong screen after quitting and relaunching, the culprit is likely the “Close windows when quitting an application” setting in System Settings > Desktop &#038; Dock. Disable it to allow macOS to restore window positions.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>I’m a little embarrassed. I’ve been using <a href="https://mimestream.com/">Mimestream</a> since it was in beta and have a good relationship with the company, so I report minor bugs or complaints fairly regularly. After a recent update, when Mimestream relaunched, its window appeared on my primary screen instead of the secondary screen where it usually lives. I had noticed this before, but I was feeling persnickety, so I filed a feature request to have it remember the screen it was on.</p>
<p>When Ratnesh from Mimestream replied, he asked me to open <strong>System Settings &gt; Desktop &amp; Dock</strong>, scroll down to the Windows section, and check whether “Close windows when quitting an application” was enabled. It was, and Mimestream wasn’t to blame at all.</p>
<p>I dislike the behavior triggered by this setting, but it’s the default, and I missed changing it when setting up my new 14-inch MacBook Pro from scratch to avoid bringing over years of cruft from my old 27-inch iMac. I turned that option off, quit and relaunched Mimestream, and its window appeared in its proper location on my secondary screen. This annoyance had affected other apps as well—Messages now opens its window properly on my MacBook Pro’s built-in screen rather than on the primary screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/Close-windows-setting.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72872" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/Close-windows-setting.png" alt="Setting that controls window restoration" width="1434" height="944" srcset="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/Close-windows-setting.png 1434w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/Close-windows-setting-1280x843.png 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1434px) 100vw, 1434px" /></a></p>
<p>Although the setting label doesn’t make it clear that it affects window positioning at app launch, its description clarifies: “When enabled, open documents and windows will not be restored when you re-open an application.”</p>
<p>In retrospect, I thought this might be a Mimestream issue because apps used to have to store their window positioning entirely on their own. But some research reminded me that Apple didn’t add system‑level Resume until OS X 10.7 Lion, which largely automated window restoration for Cocoa apps. Today, most apps rely on macOS to restore window positions, making the “Close windows when quitting an application” setting more important.</p>
<p>It’s reasonable to wonder why Apple made closing windows the default in macOS when restoration is the norm in iOS. My best guess: while users with firm mental models of an app’s previous state may appreciate full restoration now (controversial at the time, as Matt Neuburg wrote in “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2012/05/23/lion-zombie-document-mystery-solved/">Lion Zombie Document Mystery Solved</a>,” 23 May 2012), it can cause confusion by reopening outdated windows, particularly for document-centric apps. Closing windows also reduces edge cases across multiple displays, Spaces, and hardware changes—fresh windows tend to appear in predictable positions—and it nudges developers to present a sensible default window on the main screen rather than rely on restoration.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have thought to look in Desktop &amp; Dock, because the setting has little to do with either, and its placement there makes an already opaque behavior harder to discover. Matt’s article also reminded me that the wording used to be much more explicit—“Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps”—and that it previously lived in the General preferences pane. <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/news/cats-on-the-prowl-the-evolution-of-mac-os-x-from-cheetah-to-mountain-liongallery/3?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=locally%20or%20online.-,in%20a%20quiet%20change,-%2C%20the%20default%20system">Apple changed the wording</a> long ago in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion and moved the setting to Desktop &amp; Dock in the jarring jump from System Preferences to System Settings in macOS 13 Ventura. That earlier wording and location were more accurate and easier to discover. The current label describes a side effect while obscuring the actual behavior, making it easy to misdiagnose the problem as an app bug.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I’m glad to be reminded of this setting, since I like my apps to restore their state on launch. In part, that’s because I use almost no document-centric Mac apps anymore, so I don’t have to put up with old documents opening automatically. Those who rely heavily on local documents or like a clean slate on every app launch may prefer otherwise.</p>

				<tidbits:app_blurb><![CDATA[Software engineer Nikita Prokopov uses Apple’s 1992 Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines to show how macOS 26 Tahoe’s menu icons violate fundamental usability principles—increasing visual search time and error rates, especially for users with low vision.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>After 34 years, should we still pay attention to Apple’s <a href="https://dn721903.ca.archive.org/0/items/apple-hig/Macintosh_HIG_1992.pdf">Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines</a> from 1992? Software engineer and UI designer <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/">Nikita Prokopov argues that</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>the principles—as long as they are good principles—still apply, because they are based on how humans work, not how computers work.</p>
<p>Humans don’t get a new release every year. Our memory doesn’t double. Our eyesight doesn’t become sharper. Attention works the same way it always has. Visual recognition, motor skills—all of this is exactly as it was in 1992.</p></blockquote>
<p>In his post, Prokopov references Apple’s 1992 advice and uses numerous screenshots to illustrate how the menu icons in macOS 26 Tahoe negatively impact usability.</p>
<ul>
<li>Icons should help users find what they’re looking for</li>
<li>Icons should be consistent within and between apps</li>
<li>Icons should represent a single, specific action</li>
<li>Icons should be clearly distinguishable from each other</li>
<li>Icons should be easily recognizable from a distance</li>
<li>Icons should employ appropriate metaphors</li>
<li>Icons should avoid using text whenever possible</li>
<li>Icons should not reuse standard system elements</li>
</ul>
<p>When these principles are violated, as they are regularly in Tahoe, users spend more time scanning menus and make more mistakes.</p>
<p>While browsing through the HIG, I came across an even more pointed piece of advice, which states bluntly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t use any nonstandard marks or arbitrary graphic symbols in menus. They only add visual clutter to the menu and people won’t necessarily understand the significance of the nonstandard marks—for example, they won’t know what a circle, addition sign, or tilde in a menu means.</p></blockquote>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/f6470b25-adc1-43bc-ae4c-9a174b177fa1-RackMultipart20260106-192-m1wel3.png" alt="Image" width="1728" height="806" align="center" /></p>
<p>I’m not personally all that perturbed by Tahoe’s icons because I barely see them. I’m extremely text-focused, so I can’t help but read every word in my field of view, but small monochrome icons are merely background noise. Many of them mean nothing to me, so when I’m forced to use them, I just map a cluster of pixels to some action. That’s why I have trouble with toolbar- and palette-intensive interfaces in apps like Microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop. When all the icons look basically the same to me, I have to rely on tooltips and relative placement to accomplish much of anything.</p>
<p>For many users—especially those with low vision—Tahoe’s menu icons increase visual search time and hurt recognition, directly undermining the HIG’s guidance. Read through Prokopov’s examples while thinking about accessibility and then glance at your own menus: do the icons help or hinder?</p>

And he still falls back on macOS’s built-in screenshot utility for capturing menus with shadows.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>I take a lot of screenshots—over 500 since July 2025, when I started using ScreenFloat in favor of my previous preferred screenshot utility, CleanShot X. But I keep CleanShot X loaded at all times and use it regularly, too. On occasion, I even fall back on the screenshot functionality built into macOS in conjunction with several other image editing and processing apps. Here are the unique features that keep me using multiple apps for my screenshots.</p>
<h2>ScreenFloat: Floating Shots and Shot Browser</h2>
<p><a href="https://eternalstorms.at/ScreenFloat/">ScreenFloat</a> ($17.99, also in <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/screenfloat">Setapp</a>), from Eternal Storms Software, sets itself apart in two ways. First, when you take a screenshot, ScreenFloat displays it in a new window right on top of the selected window or area. (The window below shows ScreenFloat’s settings for floating shots.)</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-settings-float-example-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72842" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-settings-float-example-1.png" alt="ScreenFloat window" width="1224" height="1950" srcset="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-settings-float-example-1.png 1224w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-settings-float-example-1-964x1536.png 964w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1224px) 100vw, 1224px" /></a></p>
<p>Three menus at the top of a floating shot window let you name, tag, and describe the screenshot <span style="color: #ff0000;">➊</span>; export it in a variety of formats <span style="color: #ff0000;">➋</span>; and work with its contents in numerous ways, ranging from basic edits and annotations to content redactions and more <span style="color: #ff0000;">➌</span>. You can even run shortcuts and AppleScripts on the screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-thee-menus.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72839" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-thee-menus.png" alt="ScreenFloat menus" width="1922" height="1476" srcset="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-thee-menus.png 1922w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-thee-menus-1280x983.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-thee-menus-1536x1180.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px" /></a></p>
<p>Most of the time, I dismiss floating shot windows immediately, but they can be useful for referring to a screenshot—such as the contents of a menu that I can’t keep open—while writing. Floating shots are also handy for making simple edits and annotations without opening the file in Preview. The feature I value most, though, is one that ScreenFloat developer Matthias Gansrigler added last year—the option to export an image with an added border.</p>
<p>All Mac screenshot utilities allow you to take screenshots without the shadows that keep stacked windows from bleeding into one another. (It’s usually a matter of pressing the Option key while capturing the screenshot.) Eliminating shadows is desirable for authors and readers because shadows significantly increase the vertical height of screenshots, adding whitespace and making documents longer (see below left <span style="color: #ff0000;">➊</span>). Unfortunately, the window’s border is part of the shadow, so ignoring the shadow gives you a window that’s often pure white on the edges (below center <span style="color: #ff0000;">➋</span>). What many of us in the documentation world have settled on is a thin border that follows the window’s rounded corners (below right <span style="color: #ff0000;">➌</span>). (For some history on this topic, see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2015/04/25/how-to-eliminate-drop-shadows-in-os-x-screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Eliminate Drop Shadows in OS X Screenshots</a>,” 25 April 2015).</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/Bordered-windows-example.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72840" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/Bordered-windows-example.png" alt="Shadowed and bordered windows" width="2522" height="984" srcset="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/Bordered-windows-example.png 2522w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/Bordered-windows-example-1280x499.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/Bordered-windows-example-1536x599.png 1536w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/Bordered-windows-example-2048x799.png 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2522px) 100vw, 2522px" /></a></p>
<p>The key to ScreenFloat’s bordering capability is its cleverly implemented export options. At the top of a floating shot window, you’ll find a small document icon. Drag it to export the screenshot in your default format <em>without</em> a border. But if you click the icon to open its menu first, you can then drag one of the format icons to export <em>with</em> a border. (CleanShot X can also border screenshots, but its borders don’t follow the rounded corners of Mac windows and thus look awkward in the corners.)</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-export.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-72838" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-export.png" alt="ScreenFloat export dialog" width="366" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>ScreenFloat’s second innovative feature is that it stores all your screenshots in the user Library folder and allows you to manage them in a Shot Browser window accessible with a keystroke.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-Shot-Browser-scaled.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72837" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-Shot-Browser-scaled.png" alt="ScreenFloat Shot Browser" width="2560" height="1276" srcset="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-Shot-Browser-scaled.png 2560w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-Shot-Browser-1280x638.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-Shot-Browser-1536x766.png 1536w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/ScreenFloat-Shot-Browser-2048x1021.png 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></p>
<p>You can search for text in screenshots, delete unwanted screenshots, rename them, organize them in folders, and much more. They can even sync via iCloud if you want access to all your screenshots on multiple Macs. But the real win is that you can open any previous image and modify any edits you previously made. It’s all too common for me to take a screenshot, edit or annotate it, and drop it into an article, only to realize later that I wanted to change the edit or annotation. Before ScreenFloat, I often had to retake screenshots just to edit or annotate them again.</p>
<p>I also find the Shot Browser handy for reducing the number of temporary screenshots that otherwise end up on my desktop. I seldom want to go back to screenshots after I’ve published an article, but it could happen, and as long as I have plenty of disk space, I’m happy to see the collection grow.</p>
<h2>CleanShot X: Combine Screenshots</h2>
<p>So why do I continue to use MTW’s <a href="https://cleanshot.com/">CleanShot X</a> ($29, and also in <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/cleanshot">Setapp</a>)? Because it has one killer feature that I use regularly—twice in this article alone, in fact. CleanShot X is a thoroughly capable screenshot utility with editing and annotation features, but it also offers a feature I haven’t seen elsewhere: the ability to combine screenshots.</p>
<p>Whenever I need to put multiple screenshots side by side, I drag one of them to CleanShot X’s menu bar icon to open it. Then I drag the next one into that window, and CleanShot X indicates that dropping it will place it on the left, right, top, or bottom. If the images are different sizes and resolutions such that one appears much larger than the other (common when combining Mac and iPhone screenshots), I can drag the corner handles to resize them to match. If I have to rearrange them, alignment guides ensure that they all line up.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/CleanShot-X-combining.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72849" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/CleanShot-X-combining.png" alt="CleanShot X combining screenshots" width="1984" height="1344" srcset="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/CleanShot-X-combining.png 1984w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/CleanShot-X-combining-1280x867.png 1280w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/CleanShot-X-combining-1536x1041.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1984px) 100vw, 1984px" /></a></p>
<p>Before CleanShot X added this feature, I hadn’t had a good solution for combining Mac screenshots for years. Long ago, I wrote a Keyboard Maestro macro that combined two screenshots, but it was primarily for iPhone screenshots, which I now do with Federico Viticci’s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/apple-frames-3-3-adds-support-for-iphone-16-and-16-pro-m4-ipad-pro-and-apple-watch-series-10-feat-an-unexpected-technical-detour/">Apple Frames</a> shortcut. Napkin, by Aged &amp; Distilled, did a good job, but development on it stopped years ago, and I eventually gave up on it (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2023/04/19/the-46-mac-apps-i-actually-use-and-why/">The 46 Mac Apps I Actually Use and Why</a>,” 19 April 2023).</p>
<h2>macOS Screenshots: Composited Screenshots</h2>
<p>Despite everything these two screenshot utilities can do, I still occasionally press Command-Shift-5 and use the built-in macOS screenshot utility to create a screenshot of a window with an open menu. In these screenshots, I <em>don’t</em> want shadows around the window, but I <em>do</em> want them around the menu, which otherwise looks weird. This requires a multi-step process that involves capturing two separate screenshots and compositing them in Preview:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the menu in the desired window to display it.</li>
<li>Press Command-Shift-5 to open the macOS screenshot utility.</li>
<li>Press the Space bar, hover over the <em>menu</em> to highlight it, and click the mouse button to capture a screenshot <em>with</em> a shadow (the default behavior).</li>
<li>Press Command-Shift-5 again.</li>
<li>Press the Space bar, hover over another part of the <em>window</em> to highlight it, and Option-click the mouse button to take the screenshot <em>without</em> a shadow.</li>
<li>Open both images in Preview, copy the entire menu screenshot, paste it into the window screenshot, and position it appropriately.</li>
<li>Save the composed screenshot and use Retrobatch to add a border.</li>
</ol>

<p>A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both ScreenFloat and CleanShot X can capture windows <em>with</em> shadows by default but toggle that setting <em>off</em> with an Option-click. However, they can’t currently do the opposite—regularly capture windows <em>without</em> shadows but toggle the shadows <em>on</em> with an Option-click. It’s easier to use the built-in macOS screenshot utility than to change settings in either of the other apps.</li>
<li>ScreenFloat doesn’t, as far as I can tell, offer any way to combine two screenshots. CleanShot X can do this easily, as noted above. I hadn’t internalized this fact before, but working in CleanShot X is probably a little easier than using Preview.</li>
<li>Step 7 mentions using Retrobatch to add a border, which requires explanation. Before ScreenFloat, Joe Kissell showed me how to use Flying Meat Software’s <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrobatch</a> ($19.99) to add proper borders to screenshots through batch processing. (Before that, we used an Automator workflow.) I still use Retrobatch for screenshots already on my desktop. However, some exploration reveals that ScreenFloat can help here too—you can drag any screenshot into the Shot Browser and then export it with a border by dragging an icon from the export dialog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the moral of the story is that although Apple’s built-in screenshot utility in macOS is pretty good, third-party developers have created some excellent alternatives that offer welcome features for those who need more power. I feel a little silly using both ScreenFloat and CleanShot X, but since their most important features for my workflow don’t overlap, so be it.</p>

Rather than spend $2 billion on universal verification to prevent fraud, internal documents reveal the company developed a “playbook” to deflect regulators.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>In a Reuters Special Report, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigations/meta-created-playbook-fend-off-pressure-crack-down-scammers-documents-show-2025-12-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Horwitz writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As regulators press Meta to crack down on rogue advertisers on Facebook and Instagram, the social media giant has drafted a &#8220;playbook&#8221; to stall them. Internal documents seen by Reuters reveal its tactics, including efforts to make scam ads &#8220;not findable&#8221; when authorities search for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the same vein as Sarah Wynn-Williams’s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careless_People" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism</em></a>, Horwitz paints a damning picture of Meta as a company that would rather deflect regulation than lose revenue from scam advertising. It’s both understandable and appalling: understandable that a company like Meta would balk at spending $2 billion to develop universal verification that would reduce revenue by 4.8%, and appalling that the revenue at stake—as much as $7 billion annually—comes from scam ads that victimize real people.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of Alan Dye leaving Apple (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2025/12/05/apple-executive-departures-could-signal-welcome-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Executive Departures Could Signal Welcome Changes</a>,” 5 December 2025), a linked set of three blog posts by <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/and-stay-out.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Louie Mantia</a>, <a href="https://karbonbased.io/posts/2025/12/and-stay-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garrett Murray</a>, and <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2025/12/apple-designs-luxury-bubble/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Snell</a> argues that Apple “shifted from making products for the rest of us” to “conflating good taste with luxury.”</p>
<p>Louie Mantia started by noting how Apple’s design has increasingly used luxury products as its north star:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s no doubt Jony has good taste, by the way. He and his team designed great products during the first half of his tenure at Apple. But as he became wealthier, he started to conflate good taste with luxury. Jony often described Apple products with words about craft, material, and precision, all things that appeal to a luxury market. Apple shifted away from making products “for the rest of us” and started making products that appealed specifically to rich people. Not to put too fine a point on it, but they started making products that appealed to themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Garrett Murray expands on the argument, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jony Ive spent a decade slowly removing any trace of personality from every product Apple released. Apple went from the original translucent-colored plastic aesthetic of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3">“Bondi blue” iMac G3</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_G3#/media/File:Apple_Yosemite.JPG">Power Mac G3 “Blue &amp; White”</a> to the more refined and unique design of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G4">iMac G4</a> to… a bunch of aluminum rounded rectangles for decades. Chasing thinness, removing ports, simplifying everything down to metal and glass with no differentiation.</p></blockquote>
<p>And Jason Snell sums it all up with:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s one reason I’m so critical about Ive, his overlong tenure at Apple when he was obviously burned out, and the fatal mistake of placing software design in the clutches of him and his lieutenants: I just get the sense that those designers became untethered from the rest of us, chasing idealized product dreams based on the expensive luxury brands they wore, drove, and otherwise used every day. Not that Apple designs ugly stuff, but there is undoubtedly an antiseptic sameness to a lot of it that smacks of a design team that has disappeared up its own white void.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had never really thought about how Apple’s design has evolved, but this criticism resonates with me. While I admire Apple’s attention to detail, I’ve felt that the company’s products have become too cold, hard, sharp-edged, and slippery. Liquid Glass reflects the same philosophy applied to digital interfaces—it doesn’t look or act like anything we encounter in the real world. Skeuomorphism can easily be overdone, but real-world objects have color, texture, and cultural meaning.</p>
<p>I loved the playful vibe of the colorful gumdrop iMacs and the feel of the white polycarbonate iBook. When we traveled for the holiday break last month, I took my 14-inch MacBook Pro on its first trip, and although I appreciated having my entire digital life with me, I missed the visual and tactile experience of working with my 13-inch MacBook Air in its vinyl skin (though it too is uncomfortably sharp on my palms). I always use an iPhone case because it protects my iPhone from occasional accidental drops, but also because it lets me override Apple’s minimalist style with my own. I like color. I like texture. And apparently, I like trees.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/MacBook-Air-iPhone-17-cases-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72809" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/MacBook-Air-iPhone-17-cases-scaled.jpg" alt="MacBook Air skin and iPhone 17 case" width="2560" height="1896" srcset="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/MacBook-Air-iPhone-17-cases-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/MacBook-Air-iPhone-17-cases-1280x948.jpg 1280w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/MacBook-Air-iPhone-17-cases-1536x1138.jpg 1536w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2026/01/MacBook-Air-iPhone-17-cases-2048x1517.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></p>
<p>Apple used to know how to make products with personality. The original iMacs, iBooks, and iPods showed that thoughtful design can be both functional and fun. Remember the original iBook’s handle? Apple isn’t incapable of adding warmth and character to its products—it’s choosing not to.</p>
<p>And that choice reveals a problem with luxury-focused design: it can prioritize the designer’s vision over the user’s experience. I suspect that Apple’s designers would be appalled to see their pristine aluminum and glass sullied by cases, stickers, and skins. Apple made billions by understanding what “the rest of us” wanted. It’s time the company considered that we’re not all chasing the same minimalist luxury aesthetic.</p>

BusyCal redesigns the Day and Week views with a stacked event layout for better readability, improves visual precision in Day and Week views down to a minute, enhances drag-to-resize interactions in Day and Week views, reveals the exact start time of short-duration events in Day and Week views by hovering over them, improves handling of recurring tasks deleted from Apple&#8217;s Reminders and updates the Occurrence field to display age for birthdays.

Month name overlays are now sticky, new settings allow hiding of the time for single-line events and disable overlapping of events in the Day and Week views, and natural language processing now lets you specify calendars in Day and Week views using <code>/calendar_name</code>.</p>

				<tidbits:app_blurb><![CDATA[Paris Buttfield-Addison has regained access to his Apple Account after a tainted gift card locked him out. But his saga highlights serious risks associated with Apple Gift Cards that should make everyone think twice before giving or redeeming them.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>Happily, the case of Apple developer, author, and conference organizer Paris Buttfield-Addison being locked out of his Apple Account for attempting to redeem a tainted gift card has been resolved. For initial in-progress details about what happened, read “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2025/12/17/compromised-apple-gift-card-leads-to-apple-account-lockout/">Compromised Apple Gift Card Leads to Apple Account Lockout</a>” (17 December 2025).</p>
<p><a href="https://hey.paris/posts/appleid/">Buttfield-Addison posted an update</a> on 18 December 2025, five days after his initial post, saying that an Apple Executive Relations representative finally told him, “it’s all fixed.” Buttfield-Addison promises a more substantive update soon, but we can infer that he has largely regained access to his Apple Account and its associated data and services.</p>
<p>The key to this Kafkaesque saga was the $500 gift card Buttfield-Addison purchased and then attempted to redeem. (Some former Apple support advisors have said there was probably more to it than that single redemption attempt, but if that’s the case, Apple will have to make a public statement.) He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It looks like the gift card I tried to redeem, which did not work for me, and did not credit my account, was already redeemed in some way (sounds like classic gift card tampering), and my account was caught by that. Obviously it’s unacceptable that this can happen, and I’m still trying to get more information out of him, but at least things are now mostly working. Strangely, he did tell me to only ever buy gift cards from Apple themselves; I asked if that means Apple’s supply chain of <a href="https://blackhawknetwork.com/">Blackhawk Network</a>, <a href="https://www.incomm.com/">InComm</a>, and other gift card vendors is insecure, and he was unwilling to comment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The more I think about this situation, the more dubious Apple Gift Cards seem. It appears to have worked out for Buttfield-Addison in the end, but he had friends inside Apple and the connections necessary to trigger significant negative press coverage. But this is not an isolated problem. TidBITS reader Brian Hoberman shared <a href="https://talk.tidbits.com/t/compromised-apple-gift-card-leads-to-apple-account-lockout/32517/7?u=ace">a similar story on TidBITS Talk,</a> and a search for “gift card disabled” on the Apple Support Community forums yielded <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/search?q=gift+card+account+disabled&amp;page=1&amp;perPage=20&amp;content=filterDiscussions&amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;source=aml&amp;origin=asc_serp&amp;searchId=JQCERtN1SSaCfF6qXZ-Ikg">over a thousand discussions</a>. Scanning them reveals many people who were likely victims of various scams, but that also means Apple is further victimizing them by locking their accounts.</p>
<h2>What We Know About Apple Gift Cards</h2>
<p>Understanding the risks requires knowing how Apple’s gift card ecosystem works and where it can go wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scams are widespread:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120933">Apple warns users</a> about gift card scams and advises those affected to contact Apple Support. As we’ve seen, that approach isn’t always successful.</li>
<li><strong>There are several types of Apple gift cards:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118407">Apple currently offers four,</a> plus two older versions. When you redeem an <em>Apple Gift Card</em>, <em>App Store Card</em>, or <em>App Store &amp; iTunes Gift Card</em>, the funds are added to your Apple Account balance and can be used to purchase apps, media, and services. An <em>Apple Gift Card</em> can also be used to purchase physical items at an Apple Store or the Apple Online Store. The <em>Apple Store Gift Card</em> can only be used for physical items. Some cards may be more or less susceptible to scams.</li>
<li><strong>Digital versus physical delivery:</strong> Gift cards purchased digitally (with codes sent in email) from Apple are presumably safer than physical cards on retail shelves because there’s no opportunity for physical tampering. But you could still run afoul of other fraud-detection signals, as Brian Hoberman experienced.</li>
<li><strong>Gift cards can be bought at various locations:</strong> It seems less likely that a gift card purchased directly from Apple would be tainted, and more likely that one from eBay or a random online site would have problems. But it’s unreasonable to expect everyday users to be aware that cards purchased from major retailers could be compromised. Buttfield-Addison purchased his from “a major brick-and-mortar retailer (Australians, think Woolworths scale; Americans, think Walmart scale).” Since Apple Gift Cards don’t expire, compromised cards could sit on retailer shelves for months, extending the window during which tampering could occur.</li>
<li><strong>Received gift cards may lack provenance:</strong> Although many people buy gift cards at less than face value during promotions—mainly through third-party retailers—for personal use, they are <em>gift</em> cards, and someone receiving one as a gift might have no idea where it was purchased.</li>
<li><strong>Automated fraud detection systems can lock Apple Accounts:</strong> Due to the prevalence of scams, Apple has automated fraud-detection systems that watch for previously redeemed numbers, repeated errors during redemption, redeeming too many gift cards, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Recovering a locked-out account can be difficult:</strong> Although Apple provides <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102640">automated systems to deal with locked accounts</a> and recommends that people contact Apple Support, numerous reports (including Buttfield-Addison’s) indicate that Apple Support often cannot resolve the problem. Reaching out to Apple Executive Relations by emailing tcook@apple.com might help, but there are no guarantees. As much as we dislike admitting it, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/26/running-to-the-press">complaining to the press often works</a> because Apple hates negative publicity. Even if it’s only temporary, losing access to your digital life—passwords, photos, email, apps, and more—can be incredibly stressful.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bottom Line: Avoid Gift Cards</h2>
<p>Given those facts, I would never give anyone an Apple Gift Card, and if I received one, I would redeem it only at an Apple Store for physical items. The likelihood of a problem may be very low, but the impact of being locked out of my Apple Account is very high. And I’m one of those people who could probably rally sufficient negative press to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Although everyone must make their own risk decisions, I recommend avoiding Apple gift cards, particularly those that can only be redeemed into an Apple Account balance for digital purchases. At least the Apple Gift Card and Apple Store Gift Card can be used without exposing your Apple Account to the redemption process.</p>
<p>I’m not alone. At Daring Fireball, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/17/are-apple-gift-cards-safe-to-redeem">John Gruber shares his concern</a> surrounding Buttfield-Addison’s story, saying, “The whole thing does make me nervous about redeeming, or giving, Apple gift cards.” <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-gift-card-safety/">Nick Heer has a similar take</a> at Pixel Envy:</p>
<blockquote><p>I cannot tell you what to do, but I would not buy an Apple gift card for someone else, and I would not redeem one myself, until Apple clearly explains what happened here and what it will do to prevent something similar happening in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The good news? There’s still time to find another gift for your Apple-using loved ones. And if someone gives you an Apple Gift Card this holiday season, at least now you know to redeem it at an Apple Store for something physical.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Our friend Jeff Carlson has been writing for CNET for a while, with several recent articles that are fascinating for those curious about how our communications infrastructure handles natural disasters and large-scale public events. At the Las Vegas F1 race, he spoke with AT&amp;T about <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/las-vegas-first-responders-lean-on-at-ts-firstnet-to-stay-connected-during-the-f1-race/">FirstNet, which provides dedicated spectrum for first responders</a> in the event that primary communication channels are overwhelmed. He visited T-Mobile’s headquarters to see (and photograph) <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/inside-t-mobile-emergency-response/">the company’s emergency response equipment</a>: big trucks (SatCOLTs—satellite cells on light trucks), trailers (SatCOWs—satellite cells on wheels), drones, and RVs, among other things. Then, the recent record-breaking floods in the Pacific Northwest gave him a chance to ask T-Mobile’s emergency response teams <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/this-is-what-keeps-t-mobiles-emergency-response-teams-awake-at-night/">what keeps them awake at night</a>. It’s reassuring to know these communication alternatives exist—I suspect most of us never think about them until our phones stop working.</p>

				<tidbits:app_blurb><![CDATA[A failed update left 1Password’s app package empty on multiple Macs, rendering it non-functional. The good news: reinstalling 1Password resolved the issue with no data loss.]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>My mother just called me to report that the 1Password icon had disappeared from her Mac’s menu bar and that something was “funny” with the app in her Applications folder, although she was still able to log in to sites in Google Chrome. As I was opening my own Applications folder so I could describe what it was supposed to look like, I was already mentally telling her to restart, assuming that 1Password had crashed in the background.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered that my 1Password app showed a circle with a backslash through it on its icon and occupied only 495 bytes on disk—the app package was empty except for what I presume was Finder metadata. That matched exactly what she described—and, needless to say, it wouldn’t launch for either of us.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/1Password-zeroed-out.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72723" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/1Password-zeroed-out.png" alt="1Password info when zeroed out" width="1174" height="1013" /></a></p>
<p>Although I could have restored 1Password from my nightly backup, I figured the easiest course of action for my mother was to <a href="https://1password.com/downloads/mac">download a new copy</a> and install that. I ran through those steps quickly on my Mac so I could talk her through them as well. For both of us, the 1Password Installer resolved the issue, and all our logins were instantly available again.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/1Password-new.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72722" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/1Password-new.png" alt="1Password info after reinstalling" width="1174" height="1013" /></a></p>
<p>How could this have happened? I remembered updating 1Password earlier in the day (and my backup from last night contained the older version 8.11.20), but my mother didn’t recall manually triggering an update. Here’s what I think is the key: because I have “Install updates automatically” checked in <strong>1Password &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced</strong>, 1Password had already downloaded my update, and I merely needed to give it the go-ahead by clicking Restart Now. Even if my mother hadn’t done that, I could imagine her copy of 1Password installing the update automatically when she next relaunched the app or restarted the Mac.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/1Passsword-restart-now.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72721" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/1Passsword-restart-now.png" alt="1Password's Restart Now dialog" width="1069" height="92" /></a></p>
<p>I can’t think of any commonality between my 1Password installation and my mother’s, so it’s possible that others may encounter this issue as well. If your copy of 1Password has been zeroed out, simply download and reinstall it from the 1Password website, and all will be well again.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p style="background-color: #e3eafa; border: 1px solid; border-color: #b8caf2; border-radius: 3px; padding: 15px;">This story has been resolved; see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2025/12/18/compromised-apple-gift-card-saga-ends-well-but-risks-remain/">Compromised Apple Gift Card Saga Ends Well, but Risks Remain</a>,” (18 December 2025).</p>
<p>After attempting to redeem a $500 Apple Gift Card purchased from a well-known retailer, Apple developer, author, and <a href="https://devworld.au/index.php">/dev/world</a> conference organizer Paris Buttfield-Addison found himself locked out of his Apple Account. <a href="https://hey.paris/posts/appleid/">He writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am writing this as a desperate measure. After nearly 30 years as a loyal customer, <a href="https://hey.paris/books-and-events/books/#books">authoring technical books on Apple’s own programming languages (Objective-C and Swift)</a>, and spending tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of dollars on devices, apps, conferences, and services, I have been locked out of my personal and professional digital life with no explanation and no recourse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Buttfield-Addison’s Kafkaesque situation has been covered by numerous sites, including <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/13/buttfield-addison-apple-account">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/12/13/locked-out-how-a-gift-card-purchase-destroyed-an-apple-account">AppleInsider</a>, <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/12/13/locked-out-of-apple-account-due-to-gift-card/">Michael Tsai</a>, <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-account-lockout/">Pixel Envy</a>, and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/15/apple_dev_bad_gift_card_code/">The Register</a>, so I had expected that escalation from his friends within Apple and the negative press attention would be sufficient to cause Apple’s Executive Relations team (which handles serious issues sent to tcook@apple.com) to resolve it quickly. Although someone from Executive Relations contacted him on 14 December 2025 and said they would call back the next day, it has now been three days with no further contact.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell from his <a href="https://hey.paris/posts/appleid/">extensively documented story</a>, Buttfield-Addison did nothing wrong. Personally, I wouldn’t have purchased an Apple Gift Card to pay for Apple services—he planned to use it to pay for his 6 TB iCloud+ storage plan. I presume he bought it at a discount, making the hassle worthwhile compared to simply paying with a credit card. But I have received Apple Gift Cards as thank-yous or gifts several times, so I can easily imagine accidentally trying to redeem a compromised card number and ending up in this situation.</p>
<p>For now, we can hope that ongoing media attention pushes Apple to unlock Buttfield-Addison’s account. More troublingly, if this can happen to such a high-profile Apple user, I have to assume it also afflicts everyday users who lack the media reach to garner coverage. Apple acknowledges that <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120933">Apple Gift Cards are used in scams</a> and advises users to contact Apple Support, as Buttfield-Addison did, without success.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">I’d like to see Apple appoint an independent ombudsperson to advocate for customers. That’s a fantasy, of course, because it would require Apple to admit that its systems, engineers, and support techs sometimes produce grave injustices. But Apple is no worse in this regard than Google, Meta, Amazon, and numerous other tech companies—they all rely on automated fraud-detection systems that can mistakenly lock innocent users out of critical accounts, with little recourse.</p>
<p>There is one way the Apple community could exert some leverage over Apple. Since innocently redeeming a compromised Apple Gift Card can have serious negative consequences, we should all avoid buying Apple Gift Cards and spread the word as widely as possible that they could essentially be malware. Sure, most Apple Gift Cards are probably safe, but do you really want to be the person who gives a close friend or beloved grandchild a compromised card that locks their Apple Account? And if someone gives you one, would you risk redeeming it? It’s digital Russian roulette.</p>

				<tidbits:app_blurb><![CDATA[After 30 frustrating minutes trying to fix a broken holiday playlist, Adam Engst finally found the culprit: a “Skip when shuffling” option he had enabled last year and forgotten about. Is there a better way to silence seasonal music when the holidays end?]]></tidbits:app_blurb>
				<description><![CDATA[<p>Once Thanksgiving is over, Tonya and I like to play holiday music from an extensive playlist we’ve built up over the years. However, getting that playlist working this year proved intensely frustrating. Even though it contains over 300 songs, only a handful played when we asked Siri to shuffle the playlist on the HomePod. It made no sense—I could cause any song in the playlist to play on the HomePod from my iPhone, and the Music app had no problem continuing from one song to another as long as shuffle wasn’t turned on. Other playlists worked fine, but there was no apparent difference between them and the holiday playlist. Nor could I get the playlist to shuffle on my iPhone or Mac.</p>
<p>Finally, I rolled up my sleeves and started poking at the playlist in the Music app on my Mac. Thinking that the source of the songs might be related, I created a version of the playlist that included only Apple Music tracks, excluding those purchased from the iTunes Store. No change. I then tried creating new playlists from small subsets of the main playlist, but clicking Shuffle didn’t play anything from those playlists. Grasping at straws, I created a smart playlist that collected songs by genre and album title. Despite having 70 artists in the playlist, all the songs that appeared in the Up Next queue from shuffling came from fewer than 10. Then I remembered that the Music app has an option to ignore unchecked songs, so I turned on <strong>Music &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Songs List Checkboxes</strong>, but it only showed everything as checked.</p>
<p>But wait! Isn’t there some other checkbox that might be related? I opened the Info window for one of the tracks that wouldn’t play and clicked through all the tabs. There it was in the Options tab: “Skip when shuffling.” I selected all the songs in the playlist, pressed Command-I to open an Info window that would apply to everything selected, and turned off “Skip when shuffling.” Voilà! My playlist started working correctly again.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Music-Info-skip-when-shuffling.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72701" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Music-Info-skip-when-shuffling.png" alt="Music app's Info window &quot;Skip when shuffling&quot; setting" width="1206" height="1124" /></a></p>
<p>Upon reflection, this was a self-inflicted problem. Much as we enjoy holiday music for a few weeks in December, it gets old by January, and it’s downright irritating to have it pop up randomly any other month of the year. “Winter Wonderland” isn’t amusing in August. So last year, in an effort to prevent holiday music from playing outside the holiday season, I enabled “Skip when shuffling” for the entire playlist. I likely stumbled upon and added a few promising songs and albums afterward, which would explain why a small number of tracks were unaffected. Had I merely left myself a reminder for December 1st to reverse the option, all would have been well.</p>
<p>But this raises a question. If you prefer to listen to holiday music only at the end of the year, how do you prevent it from playing at other times? I can imagine a range of approaches, including exclusionary playlists and separate music libraries, but they would require me to change how I interact with Apple Music for the rest of the year. Other techniques suffer from allowing holiday songs to be mixed in with other music. For instance, I want to listen to everything that Dave’s True Story has recorded throughout the year, apart from their Christmas album, but I don’t want to lose track of the fact that I like the Christmas album in December. Similarly, if I ask Siri to shuffle my entire Apple Music library in June, I don’t want any holiday music sneaking into the mix. What’s your solution?</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Following its traditional mid-December schedule, Apple has released the 26.2 updates across its operating systems, featuring a mix of focused enhancements and bug fixes. The most surprising new feature is Edge Light, a video effect that uses your Mac’s display to illuminate your face during low-light video calls. The Podcasts and Games apps see improvements across platforms, iPhone and Apple Watch users in the US gain enhanced safety alerts, and Reminders finally gets alarms.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting up front that all of these updates include fixes for a pair of WebKit vulnerabilities that have been “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.” In other words, these updates address two zero-day vulnerabilities, so you should update sooner rather than later from the 26.1 versions or install the standalone security updates for Apple’s older operating systems.</p>
<h2>Shared Improvements Across Platforms</h2>
<p>As always, Apple worked to maintain feature parity across its operating systems by releasing new features that apply to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alarms for Reminders:</strong> You can now mark a reminder as urgent, which triggers an audible alarm that you must dismiss explicitly. When an alarm goes off, it appears as a Live Activity, and you can snooze it for 9 minutes if you’re not ready to complete the action. You can even reschedule a snoozed alarm. Although you can mark reminders as urgent on the iPad and Mac, alarms appear to play only on an iPhone and a connected Apple Watch. While this feature is welcome, Apple should go further by adding alarms as a third notification type that users can select on a per-item basis (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2023/05/11/a-call-to-alarms-why-we-need-persistent-calendar-and-reminder-notifications/">A Call to Alarms: Why We Need Persistent Calendar and Reminder Notifications</a>,” 11 May 2023).<a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Reminders-alarms-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-72669 alignnone" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Reminders-alarms-scaled.jpg" alt="Alarms in Reminders in iOS 26.2" width="2560" height="1694" srcset="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Reminders-alarms-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Reminders-alarms-1280x847.jpg 1280w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Reminders-alarms-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Reminders-alarms-2048x1356.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></li>
<li><strong>Podcasts chapters and links:</strong> The Podcasts app now automatically generates chapter markers, making it easier to navigate within episodes to find a segment you want to hear again. Additionally, when a podcast host mentions another podcast, Apple says you’ll see links to view and follow the referenced podcast directly from the player and transcript.</li>
<li><strong>Apple News section links:</strong> The News app now includes section links in the sidebar for quick navigation to popular topics like Sports, Politics, Business, and Food.</li>
<li><strong>Freeform tables:</strong> The Freeform app now supports tables, allowing you to organize text, images, documents, and drawings in a structured grid. Cells intelligently resize to fit their content. These enhancements also appear in the Freeform app for the Vision Pro.</li>
<li><strong>Games app improvements:</strong> The Games app gains filters to help you find games by category, size, and more. In-game challenge score banners provide real-time updates when someone takes the lead, and controller support has been improved; the iOS and iPadOS release notes specifically mention Backbone and Razer controllers.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-release album fix:</strong> Apple has resolved an issue where pre-release albums in Apple Music weren’t immediately playable at their release time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2 Improvements</h2>
<p>With two exceptions, all the changes in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123075">iOS 26.2</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123074">iPadOS 26.2</a> are shared. The exceptions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iPhone (and Apple Watch) Enhanced Safety Alerts:</strong> New emergency alert capabilities can inform US users about imminent threats such as earthquakes, floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies, with information like maps of affected areas and links to additional safety guidance. We hope wildfires, hurricanes, and tornadoes will also be included. You configure these options in <strong>Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Enhanced Safety Alerts</strong>, and some explanatory text there suggests that enabling the feature can help your iPhone anonymously alert other nearby Apple devices.<a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Enhanced-Safety-Alerts-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-72671 alignnone" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Enhanced-Safety-Alerts-scaled.jpg" alt="Enhanced Safety Alerts in iOS 26.2" width="2560" height="2560" srcset="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Enhanced-Safety-Alerts-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Enhanced-Safety-Alerts-1280x1280.jpg 1280w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Enhanced-Safety-Alerts-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Enhanced-Safety-Alerts-2048x2048.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></li>
<li><strong>iPad multitasking gestures:</strong> Apple continues to refine iPadOS’s new Mac-inspired approach to multitasking. You can now quickly tile windows or place an app in Slide Over by dragging app icons from the Dock, which makes a lot of sense within the iPad context.</li>
</ul>
<p>The iOS/iPadOS shared changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple Music enhancements:</strong> Your Favorite Songs playlist now appears in Top Picks, making it easier to access the music you’ve explicitly marked as favorites. Music also now stores offline lyrics for downloaded songs.</li>
<li><strong>AirDrop verification codes:</strong> When using AirDrop with unknown contacts, a new verification system provides an additional layer of security. The receiver’s device displays a code that the sender must enter to complete the transfer.</li>
<li><strong>Lock Screen time customization:</strong> In another step back from Liquid Glass transparency, a new option lets you adjust the transparency of the Lock Screen time display. The Solid option is still far more readable.<br />
<a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Lock-Screen-adjustment-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-72680 alignnone" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Lock-Screen-adjustment-scaled.jpg" alt="Lock Screen time customization in iOS 26.2" width="2560" height="1694" srcset="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Lock-Screen-adjustment-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Lock-Screen-adjustment-1280x847.jpg 1280w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Lock-Screen-adjustment-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Lock-Screen-adjustment-2048x1356.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></li>
<li><strong>“Juice jacking” protection fix:</strong> In “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2025/10/13/juice-jacking-protection-setting-broken-in-ios-26/">Juice Jacking Protection Setting Broken in iOS 26</a>” (13 October 2025), I noted that the options in <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Wired Accessories</strong> could incorrectly appear as managed by an enterprise organization. iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2 resolve that problem, but you should check the setting, as it defaulted to Always Allow on both my iPhone and iPad, not the Ask for New Accessories I had previously selected.</li>
<li><strong>Home app multipack pairing:</strong> When you buy HomeKit accessories sold in multipacks, you can now use the same setup code to enroll them all.</li>
<li><strong>Flash for alerts:</strong> A new Accessibility option lets you have the device screen flash when you receive a notification.</li>
</ul>
<h2>macOS 26.2 Tahoe Improvements</h2>
<p>In addition to the cross-platform features mentioned above, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122868">macOS 26.2</a> introduces a unique new feature. The Edge Light video effect uses your Mac’s display to illuminate your face during video calls, functioning like a virtual ring light when you’re in low-light conditions. You invoke it from the green video camera menu bar icon, and you can customize the light’s width and temperature there. Mouse awareness causes the light to recede when you need to access content underneath it. On Macs from 2024 and later, you can reportedly set it to turn on automatically in low-light situations.</p>
<p>In quick testing, I was unimpressed. While using FaceTime, I enabled Edge Light and moved into a dark room. It made my face visible, but the quality was poor. You can’t see the bright white Edge Light rim in the screenshot below, but it’s reflected in my glasses. I suppose it’s better than nothing if you can’t turn on a light.</p>
<p><a href="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Edge-Light-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-72670 size-full" src="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Edge-Light-scaled.jpg" alt="Edge Light in FaceTime in macOS 26.2" width="2560" height="1600" srcset="https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Edge-Light-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Edge-Light-1280x800.jpg 1280w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Edge-Light-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://tidbits.com/uploads/2025/12/Edge-Light-2048x1280.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/124963">macOS 26 Enterprise release notes</a> call out three additional changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>App privacy permissions in System Settings:</strong> Permissions configured by device management now appear in System Settings.</li>
<li><strong>Platform SSO and smart card fix:</strong> A bug that made the Lock Screen unresponsive on a Mac configured for Platform SSO with smart card authentication has been resolved.</li>
<li><strong>Console stability:</strong> The Console app is more stable when viewing log files with Now mode enabled.</li>
</ul>
<h2>watchOS 26.2 Improvements</h2>
<p>In addition to support for Enhanced Safety Alerts, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123002">watchOS 26.2</a> offers two modest updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sleep score refinements:</strong> The Sleep app adds notification controls for sleep scores and refinements to how your sleep is classified.</li>
<li><strong>Music app advance bug:</strong> Apple fixed a bug that could prevent the Music app from advancing to the next song.</li>
</ul>
<h2>tvOS 26.2 Improvements</h2>
<p>With <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106336">tvOS 26.2</a>, Apple focused on enhancing the new profile capabilities that give each user of an Apple TV their own environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple TV app profiles without Apple Accounts:</strong> Family members and friends can now have their own profiles for the Apple TV app without needing an Apple Account, giving them their own Watchlist and personalized recommendations.</li>
<li><strong>Kid profile improvements:</strong> Age-suitable content automatically appears for kid profiles across video providers, and parents can set restrictions to limit access to age-appropriate content.</li>
</ul>
<h2>visionOS 26.2 Improvements</h2>
<p>Along with the cross-platform table support in the Freeform app, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123024">visionOS 26.2</a> gains two additional enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Travel Mode expands:</strong> Apple has extended Travel Mode beyond airplanes and trains to include cars and buses.</li>
<li><strong>Spatial accessory improvements:</strong> visionOS now supports hand-drawn content with spatial accessories like Logitech Muse in Notes, Freeform, and any PencilKit-enabled app.</li>
</ul>
<h2>HomePod Software 26.2 Improvements</h2>
<p>All Apple is admitting to with <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108045">HomePod Software 26.2</a> is “performance and stability improvements.”</p>
<h2>Security Updates</h2>
<p>These updates—and updates for the last two versions of macOS and the previous version of iOS and iPadOS—address numerous security vulnerabilities. As mentioned above, two of these vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild against earlier versions of iOS.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125884">25 vulnerabilities</a></li>
<li><strong>iOS 18.7.3 and iPadOS 18.7.3:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125885">20 vulnerabilities</a></li>
<li><strong>macOS 26.2 Tahoe:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125886">46 vulnerabilities</a></li>
<li><strong>macOS 15.7.3 Sequoia:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125887">25 vulnerabilities</a></li>
<li><strong>macOS 14.8.3 Sonoma:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125888">21 vulnerabilities</a></li>
<li><strong>Safari 26.2 (for Sequoia and Sonoma):</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125892">11 vulnerabilities</a></li>
<li><strong>watchOS 26.2:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125890">16 vulnerabilities</a></li>
<li><strong>tvOS 26.2:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125889">9 vulnerabilities</a></li>
<li><strong>visionOS 26.2:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125891">19 vulnerabilities</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Update Advice</h2>
<p>If you’re already running version 26.1, these updates appear safe to install and important due to the zero-day vulnerability fixes. The Reminders alarms, Podcasts improvements, and Enhanced Safety Alerts are genuinely worthwhile additions, Edge Light might be useful in some situations, and the various bug fixes address real-world annoyances.</p>
<p>For those still on earlier operating system versions, waiting for Tahoe and its siblings to stabilize, version 26.2 is a reasonable time to consider an upgrade. We’re now two point releases in, and Apple continues to smooth out the rough edges in Liquid Glass and iPadOS multitasking, in particular.</p>
<p>If any quirks arise in your everyday use of these updates, leave a comment on this article, and I will investigate.</p>
